J	Kondaiah, C; Pais, AR; Rao, RS				Kondaiah, Cheemaladinne; Pais, Alwyn Roshan; Rao, Routhu Srinivasa			Enhanced Malicious Traffic Detection in Encrypted Communication Using TLS Features and a Multi-class Classifier Ensemble	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						TLS 1.2 and 1.3 RF; LSTM; Bi-LSTM; Ensemble; Malicious URLs	PHISHING DETECTION; EFFICIENT	The use of encryption for network communication leads to a significant challenge in identifying malicious traffic. The existing malicious traffic detection techniques fail to identify malicious traffic from the encrypted traffic without decryption. The current research focuses on feature extraction and malicious traffic classification from the encrypted network traffic without decryption. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model using Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), and self-attention-based methods. Also, we propose novel TLS features extracted from the network and perform experimentation on the ensemble model. The experimental results demonstrated that the ML-based (RF, LGBM, XGB) ensemble model achieved a significant accuracy of 94.85% whereas the other ensemble model using RF, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM with self-attention technique achieved an accuracy of 96.71%. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed models, we curated datasets encompassing both phishing, legitimate and malware websites, leveraging features extracted from TLS 1.2 and 1.3 traffic without decryption.

Already overwhelmed by routine mandatory tasks like guidelines compliance and patching that if ignored could incur penalties, they have little time to understand the large volumes of event logs generated by intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and other security tools. The cognitive gap between these powerful automated tools and the human mind reduces the situation awareness, thereby increasing the likelihood of sub-optimal decisions that could be advantageous to well-evolved attackers. This paper proposes a tri-modular framework which shifts low-performance processing speed and data contextualization to intelligent learning algorithms that provide humans only with actionable information, thereby bridging the cognitive gap. The framework has three modules including Data Module (DM): Kafka, Spark, and R to ingest streams of heterogeneous data; Classification Module (CM): a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to classify processed data; and Action Module (AM): naturalistic and rational models for time-critical and non-time-critical decision-making, respectively. This paper focuses on the design and development of the modules, and demonstrates proof-of-concept of DM using partially synthesized streams of real smart grid network security data.

There exist several methods to detect such behavior. This paper reports on a study conducted to compare two methods for detecting anomalies in CI. One of these methods, referred to as design-centric, generates invariants from the design of a CI. Another method, referred to as data-centric, generates the invariants from data collected from an operational CI. The key question that motivated the study is "How do design and data-centric methods compare in the effectiveness of the generated invariants in detecting process anomalies." The data-centric approach used Association Rule Mining for generating invariants from operational data. These invariants, and their performance in detecting anomalies, was compared against those generated by a design-centric approach reported in the literature. The entire study was conducted in the context of an operational scaled down version of a water treatment plant. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Alshathri, S; Sayed, A; Hemdan, EE				Alshathri, Samah; Sayed, Amged; Hemdan, Ezz El-Din			An Intelligent Attack Detection Framework for the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles with Imbalanced Car Hacking Data	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL			English	Article						car hacking; Internet of Vehicles; imbalanced data; intrusion detection systems; RANDOM over-sampling (ROS); NearMiss; machine learning		The modern Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoVs) has enabled the development of autonomous vehicles that can interact with each other and their surroundings, facilitating real-time data exchange and communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and the external environment. The lack of security procedures in vehicular networks and Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol leaves vehicles exposed to intrusions. One common attack type is the message injection attack, which inserts fake messages into original Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to trick them or create failures. Therefore, this paper tackles the pressing issue of cyber-attack detection in modern IoV systems, where the increasing connectivity of vehicles to the external world and each other creates a vast attack surface. The vulnerability of in-vehicle networks, particularly the CAN protocol, makes them susceptible to attacks such as message injection, which can have severe consequences. To address this, we propose an intelligent Intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect a wide range of threats utilizing machine learning techniques. However, a significant challenge lies in the inherent imbalance of car-hacking datasets, which can lead to misclassification of attack types. To overcome this, we employ various imbalanced pre-processing techniques, including NearMiss, Random over-sampling (ROS), and TomLinks, to pre-process and handle imbalanced data. Then, various Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), are employed in detecting and predicting attack types on balanced data. We evaluate the performance and efficacy of these techniques using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, F1_Score, and recall. This demonstrates how well the suggested IDS detects cyberattacks in external and intra-vehicle vehicular networks using unbalanced data on vehicle hacking. Using k-NN with various resampling techniques, the results show that the proposed system achieves 100% detection rates in testing on the Car-Hacking dataset in comparison with existing work, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in protecting modern vehicle systems from advanced threats.

Reliance of these methods on the communication layer makes it prone to cyber attacks affecting the security, reliability, and economic operation of the distribution network. In this paper, we focus on Load Altering Attacks that would compromise the operation of market-based congestion management methods. A detection technique is proposed using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). IEEE 33 bus system is used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. An accuracy of 97% was obtained proving the capability of using LSTM-RNN to detect a load altering cyber attack compromising aggregators in the network.

A malware delivered, for example by phishing e-mails, intrudes and expands into the other hosts in the LAN easily these days. Previous works have taken machine learning approach to detect anomaly caused by malware's behavior. However, there are still not so many researches that try to clarify the reasons of such anomaly, i.e., explanation of the anomaly causes. In this research, we propose a method using convolutional neural network (CNN) with a refined normalization function and learning function to detect and also classify different events happened in the LAN. We use Hilbert Curve, array exchange, and projection to generate feature maps to represent protocol information of events within a predetermined time span. We have tested our scheme on three different active network cases. We have obtained an average recall rate of 76% for detecting and classifying 8 types of events categorized as normal, arp scan, tcp scan, scan of tcp port 23, scan of tcp port 80, udp scan, scan of udp port 137, scan of udp port 1900 for those active networks.

Analyzing these streams for cyber-attacks is a challenging task. This is due to the infinite nature of stream-based datatypes. Analyzing streams can require additional real-time processing and computational performance capabilities. In this article, we focus on how concept drifts affect Botnet cyber-attack detection in IoT scenarios. To reveal the result, we incorporate the concept drift analysis to detect cyber-attacks on the Bot-IoT dataset, which consists of legitimate and simulated IoT network traffics, together with various types of attacks. We designed subdatasets of the Bot-IoT to ensure the concept drift occurs that eventually complete the experiments. The detection accuracies improved 15%-26% compared with the classification models without concept drift analysis. We also gain superior performance results by comparing confusion matrices when concept drift analysis is ongoing. We propose a technique featuring a dynamic sliding window based on the residual projection to perform concept drift analysis. During the process of finding concepts in data streams, the sample number is updated dynamically by comparing the anomalous quantity obtained by the residual projection method in the current window to the previous one. In addition to the Bot-IoT dataset, our method is also applied to two popular synthetic datasets SEA Concept and UG-2C-5D. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to the false alarm rate, misses, and average delay.

The negative effects of cyber-attacks extend beyond financial losses and disrupt people's lives on social and psychological levels. Conventional practice involves cyber experts sourcing data from various outlets and applying personal discernment and rational inference to manually formulate cyber intelligence specific to a country. This traditional approach introduces personal bias towards the country-level cyber reports. However, this paper reports a novel approach where country-level cyber intelligence is automatically generated with artificial intelligence (AI), employing cyber-related social media posts and open-source cyber-attack statistics. Our innovative cyber threat intelligence solution examined 37,386 tweets from 30,706 users in 54 languages using sentiment analysis, translation, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), N-gram, and Porter stemming. Moreover, the presented study utilized 238,220 open-intelligence cyber-attack statistics from eight different web links, to create a historical cyber-attack dataset. Subsequently, AI-based algorithms, like convolutional neural network (CNN), and exponential smoothing were used for AI-driven insights. With the confluence of the voluminous Twitter-derived data and the array of open-intelligence cyber-attack statistics, orchestrated by the AI-driven algorithms, the presented approach generated seven-dimensional cyber intelligence for Australia and China in complete automation. Finally, the topic analysis on the cyber-related social media messages revealed seven main themes for both Australia and China. This methodology possesses the inherent capability to effortlessly engender cyber intelligence for any country, employing an autonomous modality within the realm of pervasive computational platforms.

Today's common and most used method for detecting malwares is signature-based method. There is also another way that focuses on file behavior. More over, recent researches used data mining and machine learning and other heuristic solutions for malware detection. In the current research, new method based on opcode sequences extraction has been introduced. Markov Blanket Algorithm has been used as a feature selection method to reduce the number of features. Using Markov Blanket reduced features size about 99%. Finally, a Hidden Markov Model has been trained based on the best features. Experimental results revealed that the trained model detects malwares with about 99% precision and 98% sensitivity.

Mitigation of false data injection attacks on automatic generation control considering nonlinearities	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Automatic generation control; Cyber-physical security; Deep learning	POWER-SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; DESIGN	As the main frequency controller in the electrical grid, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is one of the critical components that requires high level of security. A cyber attack on the AGC system does not only affect the operation of the AGC, but it also affects the whole system frequency. Previous research works have ignored the nonlinearities of the AGC when conducting cyber-physical threats assessment. In this paper, we first demonstrate that AGC nonlinearities cannot be ignored while studying the AGC cyber-physical security. In particular, we investigate the False Data Injection (FDI) and Time Delay (TD) attacks against a multi-area AGC systems. Second, to protect against these threats, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) approach based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) framework. The two-stage LSTM framework first detects data anomalies from FDI and TD attacks and then mitigates the compromised signals in order to minimize the attacks effect on the system. We evaluate and quantify the performance of our model using a two-areas AGC system. The results confirm the accuracy of the detection model and its ability to detect and determine the compromise signals. Additionally, the mitigation model significantly reduces the attacks effect on the AGC system.

Thus, developing an efficient anomaly detection mechanism is crucial for information protection and cyber security. To accurately detect TCP SYN flood attacks, two statistical schemes based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) metric have been designed in this paper. Specifically, by integrating the CRPS measure with two conventional charts, Shewhart and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts, novel anomaly detection strategies were developed: CRPS-Shewhart and CRPS-EWMA. The efficiency of the proposed methods has been verified using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation datasets.

HMS-IDS: Threat Intelligence Integration for Zero-Day Exploits and Advanced Persistent Threats in IIoT	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						IIoT; Intrusion Detection System; CIC-ToN-IoT; Cyber-attack; Zero-Day Attacks	ANOMALY DETECTION	Critical Industries such as Manufacturing, Power, and Intelligent Transportation are increasingly using IIoT systems, making them more susceptible to cyberattacks. To counter these cyberattacks, policymakers have made strong guidelines, and various security provisions like secure authentication and encryption mechanisms as effective countermeasures for these systems. The exponential rise in cyberattacks has proven that all these measures are not sufficient to protect IIoT systems and have certain limitations. Considering the progress in Artificial Intelligence, it is widely acknowledged that Machine Learning (ML) based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) hold significant potential for identifying these cyberattacks. Numerous ML-based IDS have been proposed, which are capable of detecting known attacks but do not perform well in recognizing the "Unknown-Attacks" or Zero-Day Attacks (ZDAs) and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs); hence, one of the most prominent concerns in the cyber industry is how threat intelligence could be used to protect against these exploits. The proposed "Hybrid Multi-Stage Intrusion Detection System" (HMS-IDS) is driven by supervised and unsupervised approaches to identify both known and unknown cyber-attacks in IIoT environments. By carefully evaluating the esteemed CIC-ToN-IoT dataset, the proposed IDS model attains staggering levels of accuracy, reaching an impressive 99.49% in detecting known attacks and an exceptional 98.936% in identifying unknown attacks. These compelling findings unequivocally substantiate the system's efficacy in real-time detection of malicious cyber incursions targeting IIoT devices, thereby underscoring its tremendous potential for wide-scale implementation and practical deployment. To validate the proposed model's reliability, the performance evaluation is also performed on state-of-the-art datasets, namely KDD-99 Cup, NSL-KDD, CICIDS 2017.

Typically, such accounts favor malicious activities such as phishing, public opinion manipulation and hate speech spreading, to name a few. Although several AI driven bot detection methods have been implemented, the justification of bot classification and characterization remains quite opaque and AI decisions lack in ethical responsibility. Most of these approaches operate with AI black-boxed algorithms and their efficiency is often questionable. In this work we propose Bot-Detective, a web service that takes into account both the efficient detection of bot users and the interpretability of the results as well. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: i) we propose a novel explainable bot-detection approach, which, to the best of authors' knowledge, is the first one to offer interpretable, responsible, and AI driven bot identification in Twitter,ii) we deploy a publicly available bot detection Web service which integrates an explainable ML framework along with users feedback functionality under an effective crowd-sourcing mechanism; iii) we build the proposed service under a newly created annotated dataset by exploiting Twitter's rules and existing tools. This dataset is publicly shared for further use. In situ experimentation has showcased that Bot-Detective produces comprehensive and accurate results, with a promising service take up at scale.

Detecting log anomaly using subword attention encoder and probabilistic feature selection	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Deep learning; Self-attention; Naive Bayes; Syslog; Anomaly detection; Encoder-decoder		Log anomaly is a manifestation of a software system error or security threat. Detecting such unusual behaviours across logs in real-time is the driving force behind large-scale autonomous monitoring technology that can rapidly alert zero-day attacks. Increasingly, AI methods are being used to process voluminous log datasets and reveal patterns of correlated anomaly. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach to learning semantic-aware embeddings for logs called the Subword Encoder Neural network (SEN). Solving upon a key limitation of previous semantic log parsing works, the proposed work introduces the concept of learning word vectors from subword-level granularity using an attention encoder strategy. The learnt embeddings reflect the contextual/lexical relationships at the word level. As a result, the learnt word representations precisely capture new log messages previously not seen by the model. Furthermore, we develop a novel feature distillation algorithm termed Naive Bayes Feature Selector (NBFS) to extract useful log events. This probabilistic technique examines the occurrence pattern of events to only select the salient ones that can aid anomaly detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to associate affinity to log events based on the target task. Since the predictions can be traced to the log messages, the AI is inherently explainable too. The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a fair margin. It achieves a 0.99 detection F1-score on the benchmarked BGL, HDFS and OpenStack log datasets.

It can carry potential risks such as spreading malware, phishing, or collecting sensitive information. Though there are numerous types of malicious JavaScript that are difficult to detect, generalizing the malicious script's signature can help catch more complex JavaScripts that use obfuscation techniques. This paper aims at detecting malicious JavaScripts based on structure and attribute analysis of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) that capture the generalized semantic meaning of the source code. We apply a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to process the AST features and get a graph representation via neural message passing with neighborhood aggregation. The attention layer enriches our method to track pertinent parts of scripts that may contain the signature of malicious intent. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on a real-world dataset to detect malicious websites. The proposed method demonstrates promising performance in terms of detection accuracy and robustness against obfuscated samples.

The security of UAVs network has become an urgent need to avoid disastrous consequences. For example, jamming and spoofing attacks are the most dangerous attacks used frequently against UAV networks. The jamming attack is a stealthy attack that is hard to detect and leads to the unavailability of the service over the wireless network. In some cases, non-malicious interference and congestion in the network are similar to a jamming attack. Therefore, an efficient anomaly detection technique must distinguish behaviors in the drone's wireless network as normal or abnormal behavior. Furthermore, the spoofing attack targets the Global Position System (GPS) signal to manipulate it and deviate the UAV to the adversary's extreme zones. Some detection methods used to defend against GPS spoofing attacks are classified into three categories: digital signatures, encryption, and some characteristics of Automatic Dependable Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). This article reviews the impact of the jamming and spoofing attack on the UAV wireless network and the previous conventional security detection and defense mechanism. Additionally, it addresses the benefit of deep learning technology to show how it is effective when it applies to protecting UAV networks.

Our aim is to create an extension for Chrome which will act as middleware between the users and the malicious websites, and mitigate the risk of users succumbing to such websites. Further, all harmful content cannot be exhaustively collected as even that is bound to continuous development. To counter this we are using machine learning- to train the tool and categorize the new content it sees every time into the particular categories so that corresponding action can be taken.

Right now, during online exchanges, many people and groups are using X.509 certificates to represent their identity, so the level of excellence and reliability of these certificates become dubious. Hence, we introduced a framework which computes risk associated with X.509 certificates with the assistance of certain trust criteria and attributes. For assessing risk related with certificate, we utilized Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm, which categorizes risk in three levels-High, Medium and Low. User needs to input the certificate and the system will predict the risk associated with that certificate. If predicted risk is high or medium, system will specify the parameter due to which it triggers risk. Our framework can be applied in browser-server communication and identifying real-time phishing websites which have Https URLs.

Unlike the traditional modeling logic, we introduce the few-shot learning paradigm, the operation of which is based on quantifying both similarities and dissimilarities. As such, we designed a suitable change detection mechanism able to reveal previously unknown operational states, which are incorporated in the dictionary online. We elaborate on spectrograms extracted from high-resolution ultrasound depth sensor timeseries, while the backbone of the proposed method is a Siamese Neural Network. The experimental scenario considers data representing liquid containers for fuel/water when the following five operational states are present: normal, accident, breakdown, sabotage, and cyber-attack. Thorough experiments were carried out assessing every aspect of the present framework and demonstrating its efficacy even when very few samples per class are available. In addition, we propose a probabilistic data selection scheme facilitating one-shot learning. Last but not least, responding to the wide requirement for interpretable AI, we explain the obtained predictions by examining the layer-wise activation maps.

J	Wang, YD; Tian, YZ; Liu, JQ; Niu, WJ; Tong, ED				Wang, Yingdi; Tian, Yunzhe; Liu, Jiqiang; Niu, Wenjia; Tong, Endong			A Training-Based Identification Approach to VIN Adversarial Examples in Path Planning	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Value iteration networks; adversarial examples; path planning; path classification; automatical identification		With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the problem of AI security has gradually emerged. Most existing machine learning algorithms may be attacked by adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a slightly modified input sample that can lead to a false result of machine learning algorithms. This poses a potential security threat for many AI applications. Especially in the domain of robot path planning, the adversarial maps may result in multiple harmful effects on the predicted path. However, there is no suitable approach to automatically identify them. To our knowledge, all previous works used manual observation method to identify the attack results of adversarial maps, which is time-consuming. Aiming at the existing problems, this paper explores a method to automatically identify the adversarial examples in Value Iteration Networks (VIN), which has a strong generalization ability. We analyze the possible scenarios caused by the adversarial maps. We propose a training-based identification approach to VIN adversarial examples by combining the path feature comparison and path image classification. Experiments show that our method can achieve a high-accuracy and effective identification on VIN adversarial examples.

J	Sari, A				Sari, Arif			Turkish national cyber-firewall to mitigate countrywide cyber-attacks	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						National cyber firewall; Artificial neural networks; Radial basis function; Turkey; Cyber-attack; Intrusion Detection System; DoS; National security		This research introduces "Seddulbahir," the first Turkish national cyber-firewall system. Proposed as the first of its kind, Seddulbahir resists possible cyber-attack threats against Turkey's internet infrastructure. Seddulbahir uses the artificial neural network radial basis function (RBF-NN) approach to generate rules that can detect 21 different attacks classified as probing, DoS (Denial of Service), U2R (User-to-Root), and R2L (Remote-to-Local) through the analysis of 66 different network service flows and based on three communication protocols. Results indicate that our proposed approach detects abnormal traffic with high efficiency, low cost, and has a wide detection range, providing accurate, flexible, and effective results in contrast to traditional methods. This paper also outlines the current state of cyberspace in Turkey, provides an analysis and detailed model of the latest cyber-attacks generated against Turkey, and investigates the working mechanisms of national cyber firewall systems used by developed countries such as Russia, China, and the United States.

While some researchers have studied intelligent fraud detection, most research has focused on identifying Ponzi contracts, with little attention given to detecting and preventing gambling or phishing contracts. There are threemain issues with current research. Firstly, there exists a severe data imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent contracts. Secondly, the existing detection methods rely on diverse rawfeatures that may not generalizewell in identifying various classes of fraudulent contracts. Lastly, most prior studies have used contract source code as raw features, butmany smart contracts only exist in bytecode. To address these issues, we propose a fraud detectionmethod that utilizes Efficient Channel Attention EfficientNet (ECA-EfficientNet) and data enhancement. Our method begins by converting bytecode into RedGreen Blue (RGB) three-channel images and then applying channel exchange data enhancement. We then use the enhanced ECA-EfficientNet approach to classify fraudulent smart contract RGB images. Our proposed method achieves high F1score and Recall on both publicly available Ponzi datasets and self-built multi-classification datasets that include Ponzi, honeypot, gambling, and phishing smart contracts. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms current methods and their variants in Ponzi contract detection. Our research addresses a significant problem in smart contract security and offers an effective and efficient solution for detecting fraudulent contracts.

They provide users with different kinds of services. Anyone can create his account on a certain OSN such as Facebook, using an email and password for registration. In addition, a single user can own one or more accounts. However, this feature has a lot of disadvantages and security drawbacks, such as creating fake accounts. A fake account is a profile that exists physically on OSN. Nonetheless, it is missing identity information such as names, last name, profile photo, and other profile attributes. Owners of fake accounts exploit them (accounts) for malicious internet activities like phishing, hacking, and more. Recently, this problem attracted considerably the research community. In this context, a lot of approaches have been emerged to solve fake account detection on OSNs. However, despite its importance, this field of research is still missing a systematic review. In this paper, we introduce a survey on sixteen kinds of research studies that have proposed solutions for solving the detection of fake accounts problem. We analyzed the following themes: Social networking platforms, evaluation metrics, machine learning algorithms, and models, data scale, features, and result accuracy were studied and analyzed in this survey.

Only there are few companies concentrating on Security measures implemented on Edge Node. Gartner estimates that by 2020, more than 25 percent of all enterprise attackers will make use of the Industrial IoT. As Cyber Security Threat is getting more important, it is essential to ensure protection of data both at rest and at motion. The reflex of Cyber Security in the Industrial IoT Domain is much more severe when compared to the Consumer IoT Segment. The new bottleneck in this are security services which employ computationally intensive software operations and system services [1]. Resilient services consume considerable resources in a design. When such measures are added to thwart security attacks, the resource requirements grow even more demanding. Since the standard IIoT Gateways and other sub devices are resource constrained in nature the conventional design for security services will not be applicable in this case. This paper proposes an intelligent architectural paradigm for the Constrained IIoT Gateways that can efficiently identify the Cyber-Attacks in the Industrial IoT domain.	[Kirupakar, J.; Shalinie, S.

As a result, the security of DNN system has attracted great attention from the community. In typical scenes, the input images of DNN are collected through the camera. In this paper, we propose a new type of security threat, which attacks a DNN classifier by perturbing the optical path of the camera input through a specially designed filter. It involves many challenges to generate such a filter. First, the filter should be input-free. Second, the filter should be simple enough for manufacturing. We propose a framework to generate such filters, called ADVFilter. ADVFilter models the optical path perturbation by thin plate spline, and optimizes for the minimal distortion of the input images. ADVFilter can generate adversarial pattern for a specific class. This adversarial pattern is universal for the class, which means that it can mislead the DNN model on all input images of the class with high probability. We demonstrate our idea on MNIST dataset, and the results show that ADVFilter can achieve up to 90% success rate with only 16 corresponding points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose such security threat for DNN models.

J	Khaleghi, A; Karimipour, H				Khaleghi, Ali; Karimipour, Hadis			A Probabilistic-Based Approach for Detecting Simultaneous Load Redistribution Attacks Through Entropy Analysis and Deep Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Load modeling; Accuracy; Power systems; Entropy; Probabilistic logic; Deep learning; State estimation; Noise measurement; Large-scale systems; Vectors; Bias correction; detection mechanism; deep learning; entropy analysis; load redistribution attacks (LRAs)	DATA INJECTION ATTACKS; CYBER-ATTACK; SYSTEM	Load redistribution attacks (LRAs) are one of the most sneaky and realistic types of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), in which the attacker manipulates the measurements in a way that depicts a false image of the system situation for the operator. Due to the uncertainty in the system's parameters, system modeling (AC or DC), and so on, detection LRAs have a lot of challenges. To overcome the difficulty of devising a general mechanism for LRA detection based on deterministic methods, we propose a probabilistic approach based on entropy analysis and deep learning. The ratio of cyber loads to real loads (RCLRLs) is the major input of the proposed detection algorithm to make the presented method applicable for different load levels in the system. By extracting the entropy of RCLRLs under LRAs, our method reduces dependency on system modeling and the system's parameters. We employ the bias correction method on forecasted loads to approximate the real load in the system, enhancing our approach's accuracy. The framework is a decentralized algorithm that detects simultaneous LRAs in different areas and ensures scalability for large systems. Simulations on the IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate the proposed method's high accuracy and rapid response.

Therefore, user privacy has evolved into a critical issue in various data mining operations. User privacy has turned out to be a foremost criterion for allowing the transfer of confidential information. The intense surge in storing the personal data of customers (i.e., big data) has resulted in a new research area, which is referred to as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM). A key issue of PPDM is how to manipulate data using a specific approach to enable the development of a good data mining model on modified data, thereby meeting a specified privacy need with minimum loss of information for the intended data analysis task. The current review study aims to utilize the tasks of data mining operations without risking the security of individuals; sensitive information, particularly at the record level. To this end, PPDM techniques are reviewed and classified using various approaches for data modification. Furthermore, a critical comparative analysis is performed for the advantages and drawbacks of PPDM techniques. This review study also elaborates on the existing challenges and unresolved issues in PPDM.

Sharing high-quality data has a direct impact on how well machine-learning models work, but there will always be misuse and leakage of data. The field of financial technology, or FinTech, has received a lot of attention and is growing quickly. This field has seen the introduction of new terms as a result of its ongoing expansion. One example of such terminology is "FinTech". This term is used to describe a variety of procedures utilized frequently in the financial technology industry. This study aims to create a cloud-based intrusion detection system based on IoT federated learning architecture as well as smart contract analysis. This study proposes a novel method for detecting intrusions using a cyber-threat federated graphical authentication system and cloud-based smart contracts in FinTech data. Users are required to create a route on a world map as their credentials under this scheme. We had 120 people participate in the evaluation, 60 of whom had a background in finance or FinTech. The simulation was then carried out in Python using a variety of FinTech cyber-attack datasets for accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, AUC (Area under the ROC Curve), trust value, scalability, and integrity. The proposed technique attained accuracy of 95%, precision of 85%, RMSE of 59%, recall of 68%, F-measure of 83%, AUC of 79%, trust value of 65%, scalability of 91%, and integrity of 83%.

J	Alwaghid, AF; Sarkar, NI				Alwaghid, Alhanoof Faiz; Sarkar, Nurul, I			Exploring Malware Behavior of Webpages Using Machine Learning Technique: An Empirical Study	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						ensemble method; malicious software; bagging; random tree; feature selection	DOMAINS	Malware is one of the most common security threats experienced by a user when browsing webpages. A good understanding of the features of webpages (e.g., internet protocol, port, URL, Google index, and page rank) is required to analyze and mitigate the behavior of malware in webpages. This main objective of this paper is to analyze the key features of webpages and to mitigate the behavior of malware in webpages. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to identify the features that are most vulnerable to malware attacks and its results are reported. To improve the feature selection accuracy, a machine learning technique called bagging is employed using the Weka program. To analyze these behaviors, phishing and botnet data were obtained from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. We validate our research findings by applying honeypot infrastructure using the Modern Honeypot Network (MHN) setup in a Linode Server. As the data suffer from high variance in terms of the type of data in each row, bagging is chosen because it can classify binary classes, date classes, missing values, nominal classes, numeric classes, unary classes and empty classes. As a base classifier of bagging, random tree was applied because it can handle similar types of data such as bagging, but better than other classifiers because it is faster and more accurate. Random tree had 88.22% test accuracy with the lowest run time (0.2 sec) and a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.946. Results show that all features in the botnet dataset are equally important to identify the malicious behavior, as all scored more than 97%, with the exception of TCP and UDP. The accuracy of phishing and botnet datasets is more than 89% on average in both cross validation and test analysis. Recommendations are made for the best practice that can assist in future malware identification.

Threat actors often abuse this system by registering and taking over thousands of Internet domains every day. These serve to launch various types of cyber-attacks, such as spam, phishing, botnets, and drive-by downloads. Currently, the main countermeasure addressing such threat is reactive blacklisting. Since cyber-attacks are mainly performed for short periods, reactive methods are usually too late and hence ineffective. As a result, new approaches to early identification of malicious websites are needed. In the recent decade, many novel papers were published offering systems to calculate domain reputation for domains that are not listed in common black-lists. This research implements three such approaches and evaluates their effectiveness in detecting malicious phishing domains. The social network analysis technique performed best, as it achieved a 60.71% detection rate with a false positive rate of only 0.35%.

Specifically, at any time novel malware emerges, the conventional security systems prove inept until the signatures are brought up to date. Moreover, the bulk of machine-learning based solutions rely on supervised training, which generally leads to an added burden for the admin to label the network traffic and to re-train the system periodically. Consequently, the major contribution of this paper is an outline of an unsupervised machine learning approach to cybersecurity, in particular, a proposal to use sparse autoencoders to detect the malicious behaviour of hosts in the network. We put forward a means of botnet detection through the analysis of data in the form of Netflows for a use case.

Online False Data Injection Attack Detection With Wavelet Transform and Deep Neural Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						AC state estimation; cyber-attack detection; deep neural network (DNN); discrete wavelet transform (DWT); false data injection attack (FDIA)	STATE ESTIMATION; SYSTEMS	State estimation is critical to the operation and control of modern power systems. However, many cyber-attacks, such as false data injection attacks, can circumvent conventional detection methods and interfere the normal operation of grids. While there exists research focusing on detecting such attacks in dc state estimation, attack detection in ac systems is also critical, since ac state estimation is more widely employed in power utilities. In this paper, we propose a new false data injection attack detection mechanism for ac state estimation. When malicious data are injected in the state vectors, their spatial and temporal data correlations may deviate from those in normal operating conditions. The proposed mechanism can effectively capture such inconsistency by analyzing temporally consecutive estimated system states using wavelet transform and deep neural network techniques. We assess the performance of the proposed mechanism with comprehensive case studies on IEEE 118- and 300-bus power systems. The results indicate that the mechanism can achieve a satisfactory attack detection accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary sensitivity test on the control parameters of the proposed mechanism.	[Yu, James J. Q.; Hou, Yunhe; Li, Victor O.

Recent studies indicate that cyber threat intelligence plays a crucial role in implementing proactive defense operations. It provides a knowledge-sharing platform that not only increases security awareness and readiness but also enables the collaborative defense to diminish the effectiveness of potential attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure distributed model to facilitate cyber threat intelligence sharing among diverse participants. The proposed model uses blockchain technology to assure tamper-proof record-keeping and smart contracts to guarantee immutable logic. We use an open-source permissioned blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, to implement the blockchain application. We also utilize the flexibility and management capabilities of Software-Defined Networking to be integrated with the proposed sharing platform to enhance defense perspectives against threats in the system. In the end, collaborative DDoS attack mitigation is taken as a case study to demonstrate our approach.

J	Yong, Y; Ye, KH				Yong, Yan; Ye, Kunhui			Novel cyber-physical architecture for optimal operation of renewable-based smart city considering false data injection attacks: Digital twin technologies for smart city infrastructure management	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS			English	Article						Optimal scheduling; False data injection attacks; Smart cities; Dragonfly optimization technique; Cybersecurity	ENERGY MANAGEMENT; DEEP; MICROGRIDS	Smart grid is considered a cyber-physical system, which is a combination of physical devices and computational processes. Since there are lots of interactions between the cyber layer and the physical layer, the operation, management, and security of the entire system are crucial topics that must be taken into account. In this regard, this paper tackles two problems in AC MGs, as a special case of smart cities. Firstly, a framework is proposed to solve the optimal scheduling problem in these systems. In this stage, the optimal management and scheduling of the system are structured and modeled as an optimization problem. The dragonfly is utilized as a powerful optimization technique to solve this optimization problem. It is worth noting that in this paper different renewable energy sources, as well as batteries are considered. Since cyber-attacks are among the greatest threats to the system and can cause disruption and outage in smart grids, in this paper a deep-learning-based method called long short-term memory along with the concept of prediction interval is utilized to develop a cyber-attack detection model for false data injection attacks on smart meters. The proposed cyber-attack detection model is first trained using historical data and then is used in real-time for detection. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling scheme, the modified IEEE 33-bus test system is utilized. Also, for testing the proposed cyber-attack detection model a real-world dataset is used. The simulation results show the great performance and effectiveness of both proposed methodologies. It should be noted that all model are simulated in digital twin simulator. The novel LSTM-based cyber-attack detection model enhances security in electric grids, demonstrating remarkable accuracy.

Nowadays, MASs have a wide range of applications in smart grids, smart manufacturing, sensor networks, and intelligent transportation systems. Control of the MASs are often coordinated through information interaction among agents, which is one of the most important factors affecting coordination and cooperation performance. However, unexpected physical faults and cyber attacks on a single agent may spread to other agents via information interaction very quickly, and thus could lead to severe degradation of the whole system performance and even destruction of MASs. This paper is concerned with the safety/security analysis and synthesis of MASs arising from physical faults and cyber attacks, and our goal is to present a comprehensive survey on recent results on fault estimation, detection, diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of MASs, and cyber attack detection and secure control of MASs subject to two typical cyber attacks. Finally, the paper concludes with some potential future research topics on the security issues of MASs.

J	Martín, A; Lara-Cabrera, R; Camacho, D				Martin, Alejandro; Lara-Cabrera, Raul; Camacho, David			Android malware detection through hybrid features fusion and ensemble classifiers: The AndroPyTool framework and the OmniDroid dataset	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Malware analysis; Android; Hybrid features fusion; Malware dataset		Cybersecurity has become a major concern for society, mainly motivated by the increasing number of cyber attacks and the wide range of targeted objectives. Due to the popularity of smartphones and tablets, Android devices are considered an entry point in many attack vectors. Malware applications are among the most used tactics and tools to perpetrate a cyber attack, so it is critical to study new ways of detecting them. In these detection mechanisms, machine learning has been used to build classifiers that are effective in discerning if an application is malware or benignware. However, training such classifiers require big amounts of labelled data which, in this context, consist of categorised malware and benignware Android applications represented by a set of features able to describe their behaviour. For that purpose, in this paper we present OmniDroid, a large and comprehensive dataset of features extracted from 22,000 real malware and goodware samples, aiming to help anti-malware tools creators and researchers when improving, or developing, new mechanisms and tools for Android malware detection. Furthermore, the characteristics of the dataset make it suitable to be used as a benchmark dataset to test classification and clustering algorithms or new representation techniques, among others. The dataset has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License and was built using AndroPyTool, our automated framework for dynamic and static analysis of Android applications. Finally, we test a set of ensemble classifiers over this dataset and propose a malware detection approach based on the fusion of static and dynamic features through the combination of ensemble classifiers. The experimental results show the feasibility and potential usability (for the machine learning, soft computing and cyber security communities) of our automated framework and the publicly available dataset.

As a victim, we consider RL agents whose objective is to find a policy that maximizes reward in infinite-horizon problem settings. The attacker can manipulate the rewards and the transition dynamics in the learning environment at training-time, and is interested in doing so in a stealthy manner. We propose an optimization framework for finding an optimal stealthy attack for different measures of attack cost. We provide lower/upper bounds on the attack cost, and instantiate our attacks in two settings: (i) an offline setting where the agent is doing planning in the poisoned environment, and (ii) an online setting where the agent is learning a policy with poisoned feedback. Our results show that the attacker can easily succeed in teaching any target policy to the victim under mild conditions and highlight a significant security threat to reinforcement learning agents in practice.

DDoS is the serious security threat, it challenge the accessibility of resources to legitimate clients. This attack causes the denial of service to genuine user due to flooding of traffic from unauthorized user. Various kind of DDoS attack are identified which include tcp, syn flood, ping flood attack, udp flood, smurf attack. Researchers have used various defense mechanisms for detection of DDoS attack, various data mining algorithm is also used for detection approach Clustering, classification, regression, neural network, Bayesian are few of the algorithm which previously used for attack detection. From research analysis, clustering and classification algorithm of data mining gives best result in terms of accuracy, time, true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative rate and detection rate. When clustering algorithm combines with classification algorithm give high accuracy. In this paper we are going to discuss varied study conducted by different researchers.

We introduce Lumen, a learning-based framework that exposes influence cues in text: (i) persuasion, (ii) framing, (iii) emotion, (iv) objectivity/subjectivity, (v) guilt/blame, and (vi) use of emphasis. Lumen was trained with a newly developed dataset of 3K texts comprised of disinformation, phishing, hyperpartisan news, and mainstream news. Evaluation of Lumen in comparison to other learning models showed that Lumen and LSTM presented the best F1-micro score, but Lumen yielded better interpretability. Our results highlight the promise of ML to expose influence cues in text, toward the goal of application in automatic labeling tools to improve the accuracy of human-based detection and reduce the likelihood of users falling for deceptive online content.

The great technological leaps brought with them new modalities of cybercrime, the number of victims of cybercriminals has increased considerably. The objective of this study is to determine the state of the art about Mobile Applications and their impact on Computer Crime Prevention. Therefore, it has become necessary to know what preventive measures are being taken, such as techniques for detecting computer crimes, their modalities and their classification. To close this knowledge gap, a systematic literature review (SLR), a methodology proposed by Kitchenham & Charters, was proposed to obtain the detection techniques and classification of computer crimes based on the review of 68 papers published between the years 2017 and 2022. Likewise, different tables and graphs of the selected studies are provided, which offer additional information such as the most used keywords per paper, biometric networks, among others.

That is, fraudsters are trying to misuse personal user information, using tricky text messages, sometimes included with a fake URL that asks for this personal information, such as passwords, usernames, etc. In the world of Machine Learning, several approaches have tried to attitudinize this problem, but the lack of available data resources was commonly the main drawback towards a good enough solution. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest a dataset extension technique for small datasets, based on an Out Of Distribution (OOD) metric. Hence, different approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were suggested, yet GANs are hard to train whenever datasets are limited in terms of sample size. In this paper, we present a GAN-like method that imitates the generator concept of GANs for the purpose of limited datasets extension, using the OOD concept. By using a sophisticated text generation method, we show how to apply it over datasets from the domain of fraud and spam detection in SMS messages, and achieve over 25% relative improvement, compared to two other solutions. In addition, due to the class imbalance in typical spam datasets, our approach is being examined over another dataset, in order to verify that the false alarm rate is low enough.

Multilayer Self-Defense System to Protect Enterprise Cloud	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA			English	Article						Cybersecurity; cyber threats; cyber-attacks; attack mitigation system	ATTACKS	A data breach can seriously impact organizational intellectual property, resources, time, and product value. The risk of system intrusion is augmented by the intrinsic openness of commonly utilized technologies like TCP/IP protocols. As TCP relies on IP addresses, an attacker may easily trace the IP address of the organization. Given that many organizations run the risk of data breach and cyber-attacks at a certain point, a repeatable and well-developed incident response framework is critical to shield them. Enterprise cloud possesses the challenges of security, lack of transparency, trust and loss of controls. Technology eases quickens the processing of information but holds numerous risks including hacking and confidentiality problems. The risk increases when the organization outsources the cloud storage services through the vendor and suffers from security breaches and need to create security systems to prevent data networks from being compromised. The business model also leads to insecurity issues which derail its popularity. An attack mitigation system is the best solution to protect online services from emerging cyber-attacks. This research focuses on cloud computing security, cyber threats, machine learning-based attack detection, and mitigation system. The proposed SDN-based multilayer machine learning-based self-defense system effectively detects and mitigates the cyber-attack and protects cloud-based enterprise solutions. The results show the accuracy of the proposed machine learning techniques and the effectiveness of attack detection and the mitigation system.

Based on the access behavior of users, this paper proposes an ISTBN access authentication approach to prevent the spoofing attack, which is the most prominent security threat in ISTBNs. Concretely, we model the access authentication as a machine learning classification task with spatial-temporal characteristics. In this way, the dependency on identification information can be avoided, which is easy to be copied by adversaries in spoofing attacks. Then, we design an ensemble learning classifier to judge the legality of the access to ISTBNs. By organically integrating tree-based models and deep learning through the soft voting method, the detection performance of unauthorized access can be improved. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of our approach for preventing unauthorized access to ISTBNs.

Among the many methods and approaches for detecting anomalies in network traffic, the most popular are machine learning methods that allow one to achieve high accuracy with minimal errors. One of the ways to improve the efficiency of anomaly detection using machine learning is the use of artificial neural networks of complex architecture, in particular, networks with long short-term memory (LSTM), which have demonstrated high efficiency in many areas. The paper is devoted to the study of the capabilities of LSTM neural networks for detecting network anomalies. It proposes using LSTM neural networks to detect network anomalies caused by cyber attacks to bypass Web Application Firewall vulnerabilities that are very difficult to detect by other means. For this purpose, it is proposed to use LSTM in conjunction with an autoencoder. The issues of software implementation of the proposed approach are considered. The experimental results obtained using the generated dataset confirmed the high efficiency of the developed approach. Experiments have shown that the proposed approach allows detecting cyber attacks in real or near real time.

Therefore, the availability of effective and reliable morphing attack detectors is strongly needed. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a double Siamese architecture to tackle the morphing attack detection task in the differential scenario, in which two images, a trusted live acquired image and a probe image (morphed or bona fide) are given as the input for the system. In particular, the presented framework aimed to merge the information computed by two different modules to predict the final score. The first one was designed to extract information about the identity of the input faces, while the second module was focused on the detection of artifacts related to the morphing process. Experimental results were obtained through several and rigorous cross-dataset tests, exploiting three well-known datasets, namely PMDB, MorphDB, and AMSL, containing automatic and manually refined facial morphed images, showing that the proposed framework was able to achieve satisfying results.

A novel adaptive network intrusion detection system for internet of things	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LEARNING APPROACH; ENSEMBLE; MODEL	Cyber-attack is one of the most challenging aspects of information technology. After the emergence of the Internet of Things, which is a vast network of sensors, technology started moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), many IoT based devices interplay in most of the application wings like defence, healthcare, home automation etc., As the technology escalates, it gives an open platform for raiders to hack the network devices. Even though many traditional methods and Machine Learning algorithms are designed hot, still it "Have a Screw Loose" in detecting the cyber-attacks. To "Pull the Plug on" an effective "Intrusion Detection System (IDS)" is designed with "Deep Learning" technique. This research work elucidates the importance in detecting the cyber-attacks as "Anomaly" and "Normal". Fast Region-Based Convolution Neural Network (Fast R-CNN), a deep convolution network is implemented to develop an efficient and adaptable IDS. After hunting many research papers and articles, "Gradient Boosting" is found to be a powerful optimizer algorithm that gives us a best results when compared to other existing methods. This algorithm uses "Regression" tactics, a statistical technique to predict the continuous target variable that correlates between the variables. To create a structured valid dataset, a stacked model is made by implementing the two most popular dimensionality reduction techniques Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithms. The brainwaves made us to hybridize Fast R-CNN and Gradient Boost Regression (GBR) which reduces the loss function, processing time and boosts the model's performance. All the above said methods are trained and tested with NIDS dataset V.10 2017. Finally, the "Decision Making" model decides the best result by giving an alert message.

J	Wei, HQ; Ai, Q; Zhai, Y; Zhang, YT				Wei, Hongqian; Ai, Qiang; Zhai, Yong; Zhang, Youtong			Automotive Security: Threat Forewarning and ECU Source Mapping Derived From Physical Features of Network Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent connected vehicle (ICV); electric control unit (ECU); threat forewarning; bit-block groups; feature extraction		Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs), have developed rapidly towards information networking, and they are destined to become an important carrier of future travel. However, they also face some challenges like cyber-security. Controller Area Network (CAN), as a typical communication medium of ICVs, is very vulnerable to cyber-attacks since they lack identity authentication and message encryption. Therefore, how to pinpoint the source of abnormal messages, also namely Electronic Control Unit (ECU) source mapping scheme, is of significance to the in-vehicle communication. However, most existing studies that utilize learning algorithms consider little on the stability of training features. To this end, this paper develops a hybrid-feature-extraction based ECU mapping scheme derived from physical features of network signals. In detail, more stable bit-block groups and mode value of high-level voltages are extracted as training features. On this basis, single-layer Softmax classifier is formulated to accurately identify ECU sources. Finally, the proposed scheme is experimentally validated with eight ECUs in a real-world vehicle. Results show that the average identification accuracy of all ECUs is close to 98%, which has been improved by more than 6% compared with other typical methods. The present study effectively addresses the deficiency of identity authentication in CAN.

However, most existing methods require the query authority of the target during their work. In a more practical situation, the attacker will be easily detected because of too many queries, and this problem is especially obvious under the black-box setting. To solve the problem, we propose the Attack Without a Target Model (AWTM). Our algorithm does not specify any target model in generating adversarial examples, so it does not need to query the target. Experimental results show that it achieved a maximum attack success rate of 81.78% in the MNIST data set and 87.99% in the CIFAR-10 data set. In addition, it has a low time cost because it is a GAN-based method.

Feature-based Malicious URL and Attack Type Detection Using Multi-class Classification	ISECURE-ISC INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						Malicious URLs; Feature Extraction; Multi-class Classification; Batch and Online Learning; Web Security		Nowadays, malicious URLs are the common threat to the businesses, social networks, net-banking. Existing approaches have focused on binary detection i.e., either the URL is malicious or benign. Very few literature is found which focused on the detection of malicious URLs and their attack types. Hence, it becomes necessary to know the attack type and adopt an effective countermeasure. This paper proposes a methodology to detect malicious URLs and the type of attacks based on multi-class classification. In this work, we propose 42 new features of spam, phishing and malware URLs. These features are not considered in the earlier studies for malicious URLs detection and attack types identification. Binary and multi-class dataset is constructed using 49935 malicious and benign URLs. It consists of 26041 benign and 23894 malicious URLs containing 11297 malware, 8976 phishing and 3621 spam URLs. To evaluate the proposed approach, the state-of-the-art supervised batch and online machine learning classifiers are used. Experiments are performed on the binary and multi-class dataset using the aforementioned machine learning classifiers. It is found that, confidence weighted learning classifier achieves the best 98.44% average detection accuracy with 1.56% error-rate in the multi-class setting and 99.86% detection accuracy with negligible error-rate of 0.14% in binary setting using our proposed URL features.

If we assume the defense stays in the same level, this means 6 times more loss than before. Phishing attacks are targeting not just companies but also private individuals, however actual data is not available on individual attack, so the real effect on individuals, their cumulative loss with business is unknown. This study targets the review of mobile attacks and available prevention assets and materials. This paper collects evidences on how simplified - mobile - interfaces according to PC reduces the opportunity to identify cyberattacks as phishing attack. The goal of this document is to point out minor differences between PC-s and mobiles and their user behavior. Mobile devices are widely used and widely targeted by attackers and mobile devices in contrast with PC provides fewer opportunity and feedback to users to avoid attacks.

Traditional face manipulation detection methods often struggle with limited frequency information, hindering their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel face tampering detection framework that combines multi-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and vision transformer. By extracting multi-level frequency features using DWT and capturing global inconsistencies across local face areas through the vision transformer, our approach reveals discriminative details and frequency information. We evaluate our method on public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.86% and 99.92% on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF, respectively. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in detecting deepfake face images, paving the way for more robust facial manipulation detection systems. The source code of our proposed algorithm and the related datasets are available at https://github.com/shawn-zhangxiang/MLFFE_ViT.

However, recent research found that power system state estimators are vulnerable to a new type of cyber-attack, called false data injection attack (FDIA). In order to ensure the security of power system operation and control, a hybrid FDIA detection mechanism utilizing temporal correlation is proposed. The proposed mechanism combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technology and machine learning. For the purpose of identifying the features of FDIA, VMD is used to decompose the system state time series into an ensemble of components with different frequencies. Furthermore, due to the lack of online model updating ability in a traditional extreme learning machine, an OS-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) which has sequential learning ability is used as a detector for identifying FDIA. The proposed detection mechanism is evaluated on the IEEE-14 bus system using real load data from an independent system operator in New York. Apart from detection accuracy, the impact of attack intensity and environment noise on the performance of the proposed method are tested. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method.

To address this problem, Japanese law enforcement agencies such as the police have been detecting fake shopping sites through information provided by a third party and by conducting manual investigations. However, this current approach is quite inefficient. Despite a number of recent studies that use machine learning to detect fake sites, there is still no system for automatically detecting fake shopping sites. Therefore, in this study, we developed an automatic detection system for fake shopping sites to solve the problem of detection inefficiency faced by law enforcement agencies in Japan. The proposed system successfully identified an average of 118,000 target URLs per day from the list of newly registered domains and collected an average of 51,000 sets of HTML data. Also, it was able to determine with 98.5% accuracy using machine learning whether the collected data were fake shopping sites or not. Since this system was able to meet the time requirements for actual operation, we developed an automatic detection system for fake Japanese shopping sites.

In this article, we are interested in analyzing the behavior of multiple fake accounts that try to bypass the OSN regulation. In the context of social media manipulation detection, we focus on the special case of multiple Identity accounts (Sockpuppet) created on English Wikipedia (EnWiki). We set up a complete methodology spanning from the data extraction from EnWiki to the training and testing of our selected data using several machine learning algorithms. In our methodology we propose a set of features that grows on previous literature to use in automatic data analysis in order to detect the Sockpuppets accounts created on EnWiki. We apply them on a database of 10.000 user accounts. The results compare several machine learning algorithms to show that our new features and training data enable to detect 99% of fake accounts, improving previous results from the literature.

Hence, monitoring the probing activities is imperative to help security practitioners enhancing their awareness about Internet's large-scale events or peculiar events targeting their network. In this paper, we present a framework for an improved and efficient monitoring of the probing activities targeting network telescopes. Particularly, we model the probing rates which are a good indicator for measuring the cyber-security risk targeting network services. The approach consists of first inferring groups of network ports sharing similar probing characteristics through a new affinity metric capturing both temporal and semantic similarities between ports. Then, sequences of probing rates targeting similar ports are used as inputs to stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict probing rates 1 hour and 1 day in advance. Finally, we describe two monitoring indicators that use the prediction models to infer anomalous probing traffic and to raise early threat warnings. We show that LSTM networks can accurately predict probing rates, outperforming the non-stationary autoregressive model, and we demonstrate that the monitoring indicators are efficient in assessing the cyber-security risk related to vulnerability disclosure.

However, its vulnerability against presentation attacks poses a significant security threat. Though presentation attack detection (PAD) methods try to address this issue, they often fail in generalizing to unseen attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework for PAD using a one-class classifier, where the representation used is learned with a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN). A novel loss function is introduced, which forces the network to learn a compact embedding for bonafide class while being far from the representation of attacks. A one-class Gaussian Mixture Model is used on top of these embeddings for the PAD task. The proposed framework introduces a novel approach to learn a robust PAD system from bonafide and available (known) attack classes. This is particularly important as collecting bonafide data and simpler attacks are much easier than collecting a wide variety of expensive attacks. The proposed system is evaluated on the publicly available WMCA multi-channel face PAD database, which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D attacks. Further, we have performed experiments with MLFP and SiW-M datasets using RGB channels only. Superior performance in unseen attack protocols shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Software, data, and protocols to reproduce the results are made available publicly.

Smart meters nowadays are capable of not only recording power consumption, but also uploading information to the electricity supplier for monitoring and billing, which makes the electric power dispatching and usage more efficient and convenient. However, the enhanced functions and computation power of the smart meter renders it more valuable and vulnerable for the adversary to conduct a cyber attack. One of the most common and important security threats of the smart meter is the malicious code due to its widespread and the easy access for adversaries. Therefore, it is of great criticalness to detect malicious code in the smart meters to safeguard the security of smart terminals. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that detects malicious code in embedded terminals, e.g., smart meters. with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network based on the power consumption of the CPU or MCU of the device. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect the malicious code in smart meters with an accuracy as high as 92%.

However, as online trade expands, other fraudulent practices-including phishing, bribery, and money laundering-emerge as significant challenges to trade security. This study is useful for reliably detecting fraudulent transactions; this work developed a deep learning model using a unique metaheuristic optimization strategy. The new optimization method to overcome the challenges, Optimized Genetic Algorithm-Cuckoo Search (GA-CS), is combined with deep learning. In this research, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in the phase of exploration in the Cuckoo Search (CS) technique to address a deficiency in CS. A comprehensive experiment was conducted to appraise the efficiency and performance of the suggested strategies compared with those of various popular techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), random forest (RF), and support vector classification (SVC), in terms of restricted features and we compared their performance and efficiency metrics to the suggested approach in detecting fraudulent behavior on Ethereum. The suggested technique and SVC models outperform the rest of the models, with the highest accuracy, while deep learning with the proposed optimization strategy outperforms the RF model, with slightly higher performance of 99.71% versus 98.33%.

Nowadays the integration of the state-of-the-art cyber-attack detection algorithms for IHEPSOC has become an important task for enhancing the attack discovery capability of IHEPSOC. Meanwhile, malicious traffic detection comes to be increasingly challenging. With the extensive application of data encryption techniques to protect communication security and privacy, malicious software could also hide their attack information, making most of malicious traffic identification methods such as port-based methods and DPI (Deep Packet Inspection)-based methods ineffective. Machine learning based detection methods have been proposed to address the encrypted malicious traffic detection problem, which usually involve constructing statistical features of internet traffic flow and training classification models for detecting encrypted malicious traffic. There are some drawbacks in the above-mentioned detection methods. First of all, feature selection is a time-consuming procedure that depends on expert experience. Secondly, most traffic classification schemes employ supervised learning methods, and the acquisition of large fine-grained labeled datasets is a tedious task. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised method for encrypted malicious traffic detection, which combines the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the multiple instance learning detector to achieve the fine-grained classification of encrypted traffic with a small number of coarse-grained labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. Thus, we could focus on the accuracy of the malware detector instead of spending efforts on dataset annotation with the weakly-supervised learning approach. To start with, we convert the traffic data into single-channel grayscale images in the proposed method, and then input them into the GAN, so that the original traffic features can be learned without manual effort. Therefore, the improved semi-supervised learning generative adversarial network, which is based upon convolution neural network (CNN) architecture, generates more synthetic samples for data augmentation and addresses the insufficiency of labeled samples. In addition, a multi-instance detector with an attention mechanism is used to identify encrypted malicious traffic from coarse-grained labeled data. We validate the proposed approach on two public datasets. Compared with other malicious traffic detection methods, the experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively perform fine-grained detection of encrypted malicious traffic.

In addition, malware authors continue to embed numerous anti-detection features to evade the existing malware detection approaches. Against this advanced class of malicious programs, dynamic behavior-based malware detection approaches outperform the traditional signature-based approaches by neutralizing the effects of obfuscation and morphing techniques. The majority of dynamic behavior detectors rely on system-calls to model the infection and propagation dynamics of malware. However, these approaches do not account an important anti-detection feature of modern malware, i.e., system-call injection attack. This attack allows the malicious binaries to inject irrelevant and independent system-calls during the program execution thus modifying the execution sequences defeating the existing system-call-based detection. To address this problem, we propose an evasion-proof solution that is not vulnerable to system-call injection attacks. Our proposed approach characterizes program semantics using asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) mainly applied in information theoretic domain. The AEP allows us to extract information-rich call sequences that are further quantified to detect the malicious binaries. Furthermore, the proposed detection model is less vulnerable to call-injection attacks as the discriminating components are not directly visible to malware authors. We run a thorough set of experiments to evaluate our solution and compare it with the existing system-call-based malware detection techniques. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution is effective in identifying real malware instances.

Security professionals seek to classify these malicious software so as to prevent their distribution and execution, but the sheer volume of malware complicates these efforts. In response, machine learning algorithms are actively employed to alleviate the workload. One such approach is evolutionary computation, where solutions are bred, rather than built. In this paper, we design, develop and evaluate a system, COUGAR, to reduce high-dimensional malware behavioural data, and optimize clustering behaviour using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Evaluations demonstrate that each of our chosen clustering algorithms can successfully highlight groups of malware. We also present an example real-world scenario, based on the testing data, to demonstrate practical applications.

The Internet has been polluted with different forms of viruses and malware since it first started. As the Internet does not have centralized control, it is vulnerable to different types of attacks. Businesses around the globe use the Internet to perform their daily tasks and with the use of botnets, botmasters have been able to gain lots of personal information from these businesses, turning their computers into a useful bot. In this article, we will take a look at different types of attacks on businesses over the Internet and different types of botnets and how they are affecting personal data. We will also address different types of destructive practices on the Internet performed by individuals using malicious codes and applications. It has not been a long time since people started learning about botnets attacks, but their evolution and usage rate has increased very rapidly in this short time. The goal of this study is to make people aware of various kinds of attacks and how one can keep their private information safe on the Internet.

This is due to their user-friendly design and the flexibility they offer. Smart-locks usually offer a convenient and secure way to unlock the door without the need for keys. However, as with any new technology, there are potential security risks that need to be considered. In particular, bluetooth security of smart-locks is very important because a leak can provide unauthorized access. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other. It is used in a variety of devices, including smartphones, laptops, and now smart-locks. While Bluetooth offers many benefits, it also poses a security risk if it is not properly secured. To ensure the smart-lock is secure, one of the security factors must be considered is the Bluetooth security. This will ensure that only authorized users can access the home or business. In this work, the security of the Nuki smart-lock through bluetooth communications have been checked.

Cyber threat intelligence challenges: Leveraging blockchain intelligence with possible solution	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Computations in Materials and Applied Engineering (CMAE)	MAY 01-02, 2021	INDIA			Cybersecurity; Cyber Threat Intelligence; COVID-19; Phishing; Deepfakes; VPN Attacks	SECURITY	Technology of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a proof-based defense framework that proactively reacts by monitoring and exchanging security-related information of advanced cyber threats among different industries. The efficiency of CTI systems may be considerably impeded by developing and disseminating inappropriate protection policies. Although global attention is on the health and the economic challenges raised by COVID-19, this epidemic is certainly being exploited by cybercriminals across the globe. The attackers use the COVID-19 to embellish brands in a way that causes workers and consumers to make mistakes, spam, and ransomware attacks are at peak. In this article, we discuss many current and new cyber threat challenges and examine the latest case analysis. Finally, we have proposed a new system on Collaborative Cyber Threat Information Exchange (CCTI) underlining a wider group's capacity to help to recognize faults via an artificial intelligence computing essence focused on blockchain.

J	Ramanathan, S; Muneeswaran, D				Ramanathan, Sivakumar; Muneeswaran, Dhamodaran			DESIGNING ENERGY-EFFICIENT DC ROBOTIC MACHINES WITH ADVANCED CYBER SECURITY FOR A SMART GRID SYSTEM	COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES			English	Article						robotic machine; cyber attack; smart energy storage systems; smart grid		In this paper, an energy-efficient direct current (DC) robotic machine ((EDCRM)-D-2) is developed to revolutionize industrial automation, eliminating the rectification stage using brushless alternating direct current (BADC). (EDCRM)-D-2 is integrated with an advanced intelligent grid structure for enhancing the smooth and soft connection process. The emphasis on threats occurs because malicious attacks are overcome using deep learning algorithms. In this approach, a hybrid deep learning-based system is used to eliminate malicious attacks. The communication protocols might operate directly over the power lines, thus eliminating the need for rectification and enabling seamless integration with the smart grid. This research offers a comprehensive, integrated solution combining energy-efficient DC robotics with state-of-the-art cyber security measures. The proposed methodologies address current industrial limitations and set the stage for a resilient and sustainable future in innovative and safe grid technology.

Although people have used machine learning techniques to detect malware in PDF files, the problem with these models is their weak resistance against evasion attacks, which constitutes a major security threat. The goal of this study is to introduce three machine learning-based systems that enhance malware detection in the presence of evasion attacks by substantially relying on evasive data to train malware and evasion detection models. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed systems, we used two testing datasets, a real dataset containing around 100,000 PDF samples and an evasive dataset containing 500,000 samples that we generated. We compared the results of the proposed systems to a baseline model that was not adversarially trained. When tested against the evasive dataset, the proposed systems provided an increase of around 80% in the f1-score compared to the baseline. This proves the value of the proposed approaches towards the ability to deal with evasive attacks.

In response to growing security concerns, various machine learning-based methods have been deployed to detect and analyze these malicious activities. However, the evolving nature of the threats and tactics used by malicious actors cast doubts on the effectiveness of previously employed techniques. These methods often encounter challenges in addressing URL obfuscation techniques and managing false positive predictions. In this paper, we present "IntelliTweet", an innovative solution designed to comprehend tweet content and accurately identify malicious tweets. This is achieved by incorporating a combination of contextual and content-based features, surpassing the use of conventional features alone. IntelliTweet takes a holistic approach that includes URL analysis, sentiment analysis, Twitter user analysis, and TFIDF-based content analysis, all working in tandem to enhance malicious tweet detection. For this system, our evaluation strategy places emphasis on reducing false positives while maintaining high precision. Through comparative experiments, we have demonstrated that IntelliTweet effectively counters URL obfuscation techniques, is robust, and minimizes the false positive rate. The system achieved a 98.38% precision, a 97.54% f-measure, and yielded a false positive rate of 0.14.

However, during the rapid market expansion of SHSs, security challenges associated with SHSs have become a primary concern of people because they are so closely related to people's daily lives. These security problems may damage information assets and pose a serious threat to people's health and life. This study investigates security issues in SHSs and provides a comprehensive overview of research to date. In this review, after analyzing the existing definition and concept of SHSs proposed by authoritative encyclopedias and academic literature, we propose a more accurate, elaborated definition of SHSs, analyze their architecture, extract six natural and contextual features, and summarize spears (cyber-attack means) vs. shields (countermeasures) in detail in the context of SHSs. Then, the security frameworks and evaluation technologies in SHSs are discussed. Different scenarios for technology integration and the practical research results in SHSs, such as blockchain, cloud computing, Internet of Vehicles, and AI are presented meticulously. After that, two special issues related to security are discussed. We believe that future research on SHS security should focus on four aspects: the unification of architecture, resource limitation, fragmentation, and code and firmware security. In addition, research on SHS security should be given priority over its commercialization process.

J	Zeghida, H; Boulaiche, M; Chikh, R				Zeghida, Hayette; Boulaiche, Mehdi; Chikh, Ramdane			Securing MQTT protocol for IoT environment using IDS based on ensemble learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						IoT; MQTT; Cyber-attack; Ensemble learning; Machine learning; IDS		Nowadays, the world of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables machines to communicate, collect data, and even make decisions which improve significantly daily human life. However, the proliferation of IoT devices coupled with their inherent vulnerabilities makes them highly exposed to cyber-attacks such as network disruptions or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Traditional detection methods based on a single machine learning (ML) technique may not be fully efficient due to the sophistication level and the variety of attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model based on ensemble learning (EL) trained using a recent public dataset containing various MQTT attacks. EL is a powerful machine learning (ML) technique that consists of training several ML models independently on random subsets of the training data and then averages the predictions to produce the final result. Basically, we propose the use of three known ensemble learning methods, namely bagging, boosting, and stacking. EL principles allow increasing prediction performances by integrating the capabilities of numerous distinct models. In order to train and test the proposed model, we also propose generating a binary balanced MQTT dataset rather than using imbalanced one as usually used in previous work. To the best of our knowledge, the work in this paper is the first that applies ensemble learning method on this MQTT dataset.

In this regard, some promising (read: scary) areas of AI for cyber attack capabilities are search, automated planning, and reinforcement learning. As such, one possible defensive mechanism against future AI-enabled adversaries is that of cyber deception. To that end, in this work, we present and evaluate Mirage, an experimentation system demonstrated in both emulation and simulation forms that allows for the implementation and testing of novel cyber deceptions designed to counter cyber adversaries that use AI search and planning capabilities.

Not only do spams annoy users, but they also become a security threat. Machine learning techniques have been widely used for spam detection. Email spams can he detected through detecting senders' behaviour, the contents of an email, subject and source address, etc, while SMS spam detection usually is based on the tokens or features of messages due to short content. However, a comprehensive analysis of email/SMS content may provide cures for users to aware of email/SMS spams. We cannot completely depend on automatic tools to identify all spams. In this paper, we propose an analysis 'approach based on information entropy and incremental learning to see how various features affect the performance of an RBF-based SVM spam detector, so that to increase our awareness of a spam by sensing the features of a spam. The experiments were carried out on the spambase and SMSSpeinCollection databases in UCI machine learning repository. The results show that some features have significant impacts on spam detection, of which users should be aware, and there exists a feature space that achieves Pareto efficiency in True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate.

Building an Effective Classifier for Phishing Web Pages Detection: A Quantum-Inspired Biomimetic Paradigm Suitable for Big Data Analytics of Cyber Attacks	BIOMIMETICS			English	Article						malicious URLs detection; cyber security; big data analytics; biomimetic algorithm; quantum-inspired computing	FEATURE-SELECTION	To combat malicious domains, which serve as a key platform for a wide range of attacks, domain name service (DNS) data provide rich traces of Internet activities and are a powerful resource. This paper presents new research that proposes a model for finding malicious domains by passively analyzing DNS data. The proposed model builds a real-time, accurate, middleweight, and fast classifier by combining a genetic algorithm for selecting DNS data features with a two-step quantum ant colony optimization (QABC) algorithm for classification. The modified two-step QABC classifier uses K-means instead of random initialization to place food sources. In order to overcome ABCs poor exploitation abilities and its convergence speed, this paper utilizes the metaheuristic QABC algorithm for global optimization problems inspired by quantum physics concepts. The use of the Hadoop framework and a hybrid machine learning approach (K-mean and QABC) to deal with the large size of uniform resource locator (URL) data is one of the main contributions of this paper. The major point is that blacklists, heavyweight classifiers (those that use more features), and lightweight classifiers (those that use fewer features and consume the features from the browser) may all be improved with the use of the suggested machine learning method. The results showed that the suggested model could work with more than 96.6% accuracy for more than 10 million query-answer pairs.

Kiran			Autonomous detection of malevolent nodes using secure heterogeneous cluster protocol	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Security; Malicious nodes; Wireless Sensor Networks; Autonomous detection		Surfing of internet by the users has been more vital from the inception of the network. However, the number of users using the internet is increasing gradually. As a result, it has also become a serious threat to users who are using the internet because due to the false information and security threat by malicious users. In this context, it is vital to provide the trusted information to the users. In order to achieve the same, the Heterogeneous Cluster-Based Secure Protocol (HCBSP) can be used to detect the malicious nodes and thereby, to provide a secure path for data transmission. Initially, the nodes are deployed, then clusters are formed and subsequently, the data are transmitted between cluster and base. The HCBSP operates over the cluster for effective attack detection and secures the data transmission in wireless network. This performance is evaluated and compared with the existing methods. Here, the result shows that the HCBSP is the most effective platform in detecting the malicious nodes with high accuracy rate.

In this case, an adversary may find some loopholes, penetrate to CPS layer, compromise data, and consequently result in security and stability issues. In this paper, we proposed a laboratory set up to emulate the attacker's behavior and then detect the injected false data. To this end, RTU hardware and software are used to simulate a typical SCADA system. A protocol analyzer software is also employed to simulate a cyber-attack, inject false data, and send it to the control center. In the second stage, we developed a two-stage framework to detect FDIA. First, the LSTM, as a supervised learning algorithm, is utilized to build a predictive model. In this process, hyperparameter optimization is implemented to improve the accuracy of the developed model. In the second stage, an unsupervised scoring algorithm is applied to the real-time data to find the sequences of injected false data. Also, a penalty factor is considered during the detection procedure to prevent the algorithm from greedy search behavior. Simulation results on a real-world data set (Chicago load/weather) show the proposed method's effectiveness in the cyberattack implementation and FDIA detection problem.

To address this problem, an optimal defense resource allocation method based on game theory is proposed to against potential cyber-attacks in smart grid proactively. Based on this method, a two-layer game model is designed to optimal resource allocation. One layer is consisted by an evolutionary game between defense nodes and attackers, and the anther layer is consisted by a noncooperative game between multiple defense nodes. Further up, the offensive and defensive evolution results for all scenarios have been discussed, then the solution to resource allocation problem among multiple nodes is formulated. Different from previous work, characteristics of the bounded rationality of the attacker are considered according to the indexes of integrity, usability and confidentiality. Meanwhile, quantum response equalization is introduced to quantify player gains. Finally, specific algorithms are employed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.

C	Zhang, YX; Yan, J			IEEE	Zhang, Yongxuan; Yan, Jun			Domain-Adversarial Transfer Learning for Robust Intrusion Detection in the Smart Grid	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR SMART GRIDS (SMARTGRIDCOMM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)	OCT 21-23, 2019	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					The smart grid faces growing cyber-physical attack threats aimed at the critical systems and processes communicating over the complex cyber-infrastructure. Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks. The framework introduces domain-adversarial training to create a mapping between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain so that the classifiers can learn in a new feature space against unknown threats. The proposed framework with different baseline classifiers was evaluated using a smart grid cyber-attack dataset collected over a realistic hardware-in-the-loop security testbed. The results have demonstrated effective performance improvements of trained classifiers against unseen threats of different types and locations.

They are commonly spread through phishing, malware and spam. One popular way to detect malicious URLs is through blacklists. Blacklists maintain records of previously known malicious URL reputations. These lists are however shortcoming when there is need to detect newly generated malicious URLs. For that reason, modern research has resorted to training machine learning algorithms to detect malicious URLs. In this paper, we contributed towards the detection of malicious URLs using URL based features in a multiclass classification setting. We focused on three popular URL attack types which are phishing, spam and malware. Our work can be used as a supplementary tool in new or existing anti-phishing, anti-spam and anti-malware detection platforms. We compared the performance of the following ensemble learners: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). We evaluated the performance of some URL features that we referred to as our features. These included priority features like Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL divergence), bag of words segmentation and other word-based features. Results showed that our features performed better when compared to experiments we conducted without our features. We trained these algorithms on 126 983 URLs from benchmark datasets and all four learners returned an overall accuracy above 0.95.

As part of this, we submitted arrays of CAPTCHA challenge-laden honey sites to 7 APEs. An analysis of the "click-through rates" during the visits from the APEs showed strong evidence for the presence of formidable human analysis systems in conjunction with automated crawler systems. In summary, we estimate that as many as 10% to 24% of URLs submitted to each of 4 APEs (Google Safe Browsing, Microsoft SmartScreen, Bitdefender and Netcraft) were likely visited by human analysts. In contrast to prior works, these measurements present a very optimistic picture for web security as, for the first time, they show presence of expansive human analysis systems to tackle suspicious URLs that might otherwise be challenging for automated crawlers to analyze. This finding allowed us an opportunity to conduct the first systematic study of the robustness of the human analysis systems of APEs which revealed some glaring weaknesses in them. We saw that all the APEs we studied fall prey to issues such as lack of geolocation and client device diversity exposing their human systems to targeted evasive attacks. Apart from this, we also found a specific weakness across the entire APE ecosystem that enables creation of long-lasting phishing pages targeted exclusively against Android/Chrome devices by capitalizing on discrepancies in web sensor API outputs. We demonstrate this with the help of 10 artificial phishing sites that survived indefinitely despite repeated reporting to all APEs. We suggest mitigations for all these issues. We also conduct an elaborate disclosure process with all affected APEs in an attempt to persuade them to pursue these mitigations.

Although numerous datasets from online repositories have been utilized to address this issue, little attention has been given to evaluating their effectiveness and impact on SMS spam detection models. This study fills this gap by assessing the performance of ten SMS spam detection datasets using Decision Tree and Multinomial Na & iuml;ve Bayes models. Datasets were evaluated based on accuracy and qualitative factors such as authenticity, class imbalance, feature diversity, metadata availability, and preprocessing needs. Due to the multilingual nature of the datasets, experiments were conducted with two stopword removal groups: one in English and another in the respective non-English languages. The key findings of this research have led to the recommendation of Dataset 5 for future SMS spam detection research, as evidence from the dataset's high qualitative assessment score of 3.8 out of 5.0 due to its high feature diversity, real-world complexity, and balanced class distribution, and low detection rate of 86.10% from Multinomial Na & iuml;ve Bayes. Recommending a dataset that poses challenges for high model performance fosters the development of more robust and adaptable spam detection models capable of handling diverse forms of noise and ambiguity. Furthermore, selecting the dataset with the highest qualitative score enhances research quality, improves model generalizability, and mitigates risks related to bias and inconsistencies.

The time-wise comprehensive database allowed us to shed a light on perishability (evolution of feature relevance) and detection performance of anti-malware classifiers. For the latter, we look into proactivity (short-term detection efficiency against future malware) and endurance (long-term detection robustness); aspects of the co-evolution of malware and security products are also discussed. Along the various training and testing timewidths available in the database, our experiments indicate that, on average, neural networks reach higher levels of accuracy in MSOffice-embedded malware detection, while Random Forest achieves lower false-positive rates.

Assessing Threat of Adversarial Examples on Deep Neural Networks	2016 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA 2016)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)	DEC 18-20, 2016	Anaheim, CA					Deep neural networks are facing a potential security threat from adversarial examples, inputs that look normal but cause an incorrect classification by the deep neural network. For example, the proposed threat could result in hand- written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the transformations that normally occur in acquiring the image in a real world application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples, resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing, such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples. This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification, adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat.

Rule-Based Framework for Detection of Smishing Messages in Mobile Environment	6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Smart Computing and Communications (ICSCC)	DEC 07-08, 2017	Natl Inst Technol, Kurukshetra, INDIA		Natl Inst Technol	Mobile Phishing; Data mining; Short messaging service; Machine learning	ALGORITHM	Smishing is a cyber-security attack, which utilizes Short Message Service (SMS) to steal personal credentials of mobile users. The trust level of users on their smart devices has attracted attackers for performing various mobile security attacks like Smishing. In this paper, we implement the rule-based data mining classification approach in the detection of smishing messages. The proposed approach identified nine rules which can efficiently filter smishing SMS from the genuine one. Further, our approach applies rule-based classification algorithms to train these outstanding rules. Since the SMS text messages are very short and generally written in Lingo language, we have used text normalization to convert them into standard form to obtain better rules. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated, and it achieved more than 99% true negative rate. Furthermore, the proposed approach is very efficient for the detection of the zero hour attack too. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Jain, Ankit Kumar; Gupta, B.

A hybrid network intrusion detection using darwinian particle swarm optimization and stacked autoencoder hoeffding tree	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						intrusion detection system (IDS); stream data mining; stacked autoencoder; DPSO; Hoeffding tree; feature selection		Cybersecurity experts estimate that cyber-attack damage cost will rise tremendously. The massive utilization of the web raises stress over how to pass on electronic information safely. Usually, intruders try different attacks for getting sensitive information. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a crucial role in identifying the data and user deviations in an organization. In this paper, stream data mining is incorporated with an IDS to do a specific task. The task is to distinguish the important, covered up information successfully in less amount of time. The experiment focuses on improving the effectiveness of an IDS using the proposed Stacked Autoencoder Hoeffding Tree approach (SAE-HT) using Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) for feature selection. The experiment is performed in NSL_KDD dataset the important features are obtained using DPSO and the classification is performed using proposed SAE-HT technique. The proposed technique achieves a higher accuracy of 97.7% when compared with all the other state-of-art techniques. It is observed that the proposed technique increases the accuracy and detection rate thus reducing the false alarm rate.	[Seraphim, B.

J	Han, WJ; Xue, JF; Wang, Y; Liu, ZY; Kong, ZX				Han, Weijie; Xue, Jingfeng; Wang, Yong; Liu, Zhenyan; Kong, Zixiao			MalInsight: A systematic profiling based malware detection framework	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Malware detection; Malware classification; Systematic profiling	CLASSIFICATION; BEHAVIOR	To handle the security threat faced by the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to the ever-lasting increase of malware, the security researchers increasingly rely on machine learning techniques based on various static and/or dynamic features. Unfortunately, the state of the art detection techniques may fail to identify the malware effectively because the malware is often obfuscated to camouflage its characteristics and thwart the analysis process. In order to identify the disguised malware accurately, a malware detection framework named MalInsight is proposed by profiling malware from three aspects which are basic structure, low-level behavior, and high-level behavior. These aspects reflect the structural features, the underlying operations interacting with the OS, and the operations on the files, the registry, and the network respectively. Based on the above findings, an accurate and rich feature space is built which enables to depict and detect malware more effectively. In order to validate the effectiveness of MalInsight, an extensive experiment is conducted on a real-world malware dataset. Our experimental results show that MalInsight can detect not only obfuscated malware instances with an accuracy of 99.76% but also unseen and new malware with an accuracy of 97.21%. Furthermore, Mallnsight can classify the malware samples into their families with an accuracy of 94.2% outperforming the typical detection approach based on the API sequence as the dynamic behavior features by almost 9%. In addition, the importance of the three aspects is evaluated and sorted quantitatively demonstrating that these aspects play the same effects with the optimal feature set.

But shielding against these attacks is burdensome due to evolving techniques used by the attackers to carry out these attacks. DoS can be any attack which incapacitate the network resources from rendering services to its users. The aim of incapacitating the network resources is achieved through directing the ginormous amount of inadequate data requests from hoax source IP addresses. Then the various attacking techniques involved in each category are broadly discussed.

Nevertheless, evidence shows that threat actors have found ways to bypass these mechanisms. As a result, phishing emails continue to utilize malicious macros as their primary attack method. In this paper, we analyze 77 obfuscation features from the attacker's perspective and extract 46 suspicious keywords in macros. We first combine the aforementioned two types of features to train machine learning models on a public dataset. Then, we conduct the same experiment on a self-constructed dataset consisting of newly discovered samples, in order to verify if our proposed method can identify previously unseen malicious macros. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our proposed method has a higher detection rate and better consistency. Furthermore, ensemble multi-classifiers with distinct feature selection can further enhance the detection performance.

Through the rapid change of answered IP addresses of the required domain name, Fast-Flux can avoid being isolated by IP blacklist and improve the availability of its services. Due to the use of Content Distribution Network (CDN) and circular DNS technology, some normal network services have similar characteristics. Differentiation between FF domain name and CDN domain name is one of the key problems in FF domain name detection. For the problems that manual extraction of FF features is complex and is easy to be deliberately bypass by the FF designer, this paper proposes a method called Fast-flux and CDN Domains Recognizer (FCDR) to self-learning FF and CDN features and recognition them based on LSTM network. By learning the domain names' resolved results collected at different times in different areas, the FCDR can classify and identify Fast Flux domain name, CDN domain name, other malicious domain names and common non-CDN domain name more accurately.

These threats can pose any potential risk within the system context and disrupt the critical healthcare service delivery. It is therefore necessary for the healthcare organisations to understand and tackle the threats to ensure overall security and resilience. However, threats are continuously evolved and there is large amount of unstructured security-related textual information is available. This makes the threat assessment and management task very challenging. There are a number of existing works that consider Machine Learning models for detection and prediction of cyber attack but they lack of focus on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the threat information from unstructured security-related text. To this end, this work proposes a novel method to assess and manage threats by adopting natural language processing. The proposed method has been tailored for the healthcare ecosystem and allows to identify and assess the possible threats within healthcare information infrastructure so that appropriate control and mitigation actions can be taken into consideration to tackle the threat. In detail, NLP techniques are used to extract the useful threat information related to specific assets of the healthcare ecosystems from the largely available security-related information on Internet (e.g. cyber security news), to evaluate the level of the identified threats and to select the required mitigation actions. We have performed experiments on real healthcare ecosystems in Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering, considering in particular three different healthcare scenarios, namely implantable medical devices, wearables, and biobank, with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of our approach, which is able to provide a realistic manner to identify and assess the threats, evaluate the threat level and suggest the required mitigation actions.

J	Sun, ZK; Ruan, N; Li, JH				Sun, Zekun; Ruan, Na; Li, Jianhua			DDL: Effective and Comprehensible Interpretation Framework for Diverse Deepfake Detectors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Interpretable deepfake detection; feature attribution; Interpretable deepfake detection; feature attribution		In the context of escalating advancements in AI generative technologies, Deepfakes, the sophisticated face forgeries created using deep learning methods, have emerged as a significant security threat. The predominant countermeasures are Deepfake detectors based on deep learning (DL). However, due to the opaque nature of DL-model, they struggle to offer understandable explanations for their predictive decisions, which undermines their reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications. Existing mainstream DL-oriented interpretation approaches, the feature attribution methods, struggle to work on Deepfake detectors due to issues of low interpretation fidelity, poor intelligibility, and limited applicability across different types of detectors. This paper addresses these critical challenges by proposing the Deepfake Detector Lens (DDL), a novel framework designed to enhance the interpretability of diverse architectural Deepfake detectors, encompassing those based on image, frequency domain, and video. DDL employs a heuristic algorithm to enhance interpretation efficacy and incorporates image segmentation and face parsing techniques to bridge the gap between the machine-generated interpretation saliency map and human understanding. Comprehensive evaluations of DDL demonstrate its superiority over existing feature attribution methods in terms of fidelity, intelligibility, and applicability. The proposed DDL significantly advances the interpretability of Deepfake detection technology, offering a more reliable and understandable tool for combating AI-generated face forgeries.

This field is constantly evolving and therefore learning to use any automated tool can be useful for both users and those who work actively with malware components to make their work easier. The notion of machine learning implies the need for minimal human interaction in order to achieve certain objectives presented from the beginning. The paper aims to present the steps taken in implementing and learning the application of an automatic tool for analyzing Office documents based on information automatically extracted from the macro code associated with them. To complete the implementation of this tool, notions of Machine Learning were used, but the learning process involves the accumulation of experience in malware analysis, notions of programming in the Python language and much other IT knowledge.

This form of attack has come to be a severe cyber-security difficulty and has triggered incredible monetary losses to the victims. Many antismishing solutions for mobile devices have been proposed till date but still, there is a lack of a full-fledged solution. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient approach that analyzes text content and uniform resource locator (URL) presented in the SMS. We have integrated the URL phishing classifier with the text classifier to improve accuracy as some of the SMS contain the URL with no text or much less text. To find out rare words in a report, depending upon the frequency of term (TF) and the reciprocal of document frequency TF-inverse document frequency (IDF), a weighting framework TF-IDF is used. We have used two data sets for both text as well as for URL phishing classifier and used a synthetic minority oversampling technique to balance the training data. The voting classifier simply merges the findings of each classifier passed into it and predicts the output on the basis of voting. In proposed approach integrating KNN, RF, and ETC can detect smishing messages with a 99.03% accuracy and 98.94% precision rate which is relatively efficient compared with existing ones like SmiDCA model which has the given accuracy of 96.40% using Random Forest classifier in BFSA, Feature-Based it has an accuracy of 98.74% and 94.20% true positive rate and Smishing Detector it shows an overall accuracy of 96.29%.

Moreover, the IoMT tries to deliver sufficient and more suitable medical services at a low cost. With the rapid growth of technology, medical instruments that are widely used anywhere are likely to increase security issues and create safe data transmission issues through resource limitations and available connectivity. Moreover, the patients probably face the risk of different forms of physical harm because of IoMT device attacks. In this paper, we present a secure environment for IoMT devices against cyber-attacks for patient medical data using a new IoMT framework with a hybrid genetic algorithm-based random forest (GA-RF) model. The proposed algorithm achieved better results in terms of accuracy (99.999%), precision, and recall (100%, respectively) to detect cyber-attacks based on two NSL-KDD and UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet data sets than the other machine learning algorithms.

J	Gao, B; Liu, WW; Liu, GJ; Nie, FY				Gao, Bo; Liu, Weiwei; Liu, Guangjie; Nie, Fengyuan			Resource Knowledge-Driven Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Website Fingerprinting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Network traffic analysis; website fingerprinting; HTTP; resource knowledge; heterogeneous graph neural networks	INTERNET TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORK	Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks play a crucial role in network traffic analysis for ensuring network security and management. Despite increasing TLS encryption for user privacy, HTTP traffic dominates phishing and pirate website. Fast flux service networks, round robin domain name system, and content delivery networks have rendered IP address or domain name-based WF attacks less effective. Manual feature-based machine learning and recent end-to-end deep learning methods have showed promise. Nevertheless, website content updates induce concept-drift, limiting their accuracy. This study exploits the fact that resource types and website layouts are usually consistent, whereas specific resources are dynamically changing. The resource knowledge extracted from HTTP request packets is utilized to construct a graph representation of website browsing traffic. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network specifically designed for website fingerprinting using this representation is proposed. This resource knowledge-driven graph learning framework can retain valuable pattern information while mitigating the impact of the concept-drift. The proposed WF attack is evaluated using a real-world dataset comprising over 120,000 malicious and more than 940,000 benign website flows. It can achieve over 98% accuracy when determining benign-malicious websites and 97.6% in identifying website types. These results demonstrate a notable improvement over state-of-the-art WF attacks.

Existing machine learning-based methods for detecting cyber attacks in smart grids are mostly based on supervised learning, which need the instances of both normal and attack events for training. In addition, supervised learning requires that the training dataset includes representative instances of various types of attack events to train a good model, which is sometimes hard if not impossible. This paper presents a new method for detecting cyber attacks in smart grids using PMU data, which is based on semi-supervised anomaly detection and deep representation learning. Semi-supervised anomaly detection only employs the instances of normal events to train detection models, making it suitable for finding unknown attack events. A number of popular semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms were investigated in our study using publicly available power system cyber attack datasets to identify the best-performing ones. The performance comparison with popular supervised algorithms demonstrates that semi-supervised algorithms are more capable of finding attack events than supervised algorithms. Our results also show that the performance of semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms can be further improved by augmenting with deep representation learning.

Kaspersky Labs detected and intercepted a total of 5,730,916 malicious installation packages in 2017. To curb this problem, researchers and various security laboratories have developed numerous malware analysis models. In Android based smartphones, permissions have been an inherent part of such models. Permission request patterns can be used to detect behavior of different applications. As applications with similar functionalities should use permission requests in similar ways, they can be used to distinguish different types of apps. However, when analysis models are trained on permission vectors extracted from a mixture of applications without maintaining any differences that naturally exist among different application categories, aggregated results can miss details and this can result in errors. In this paper, we propose a permission analysis model for android applications which includes a classification module and a malware detection module based on application permission vectors to deal with Android malware detection problem. Wemine the benign application permission vector set into 32 categories by mining the similarity of permission vectors, and input malicious application permission vector sets into the model to obtain class labels, then extract sensitive features from different classes. Finally, sensitive features of each class are respectively input into the machine learning algorithm to obtain a classification model of malicious and benign applications. Our experimental results show that our model can achieve 93.66% accuracy of detecting malware instances.

Using a Knowledge-based Security Orchestration Tool to Reduce the Risk of Browser Compromise	PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	DEC 06-09, 2016	Athens, GREECE					Today, web browsers are used to access and modify sensitive data and systems including intranets and critical control systems. Due to their computational capabilities and network connectivity, browsers are vulnerable to several types of attacks, even when fully patched. Browsers are also the main target of phishing attacks. Many browser attacks, including phishing, could be prevented or mitigated by using site-, user-, and device-specific security configurations in a diverse browsing ecosystem. However, in our research, we discovered that all major browsers expose disparate security configuration procedures, option names, values, and semantics. This results in an extremely hard to secure browsing ecosystem. We analyzed in detail more than a thousand browser security configuration options in three major browsers and found that only 17 had common names with common semantics. In this paper, we describe the results of this in-depth analysis. We also describe a knowledge-based solution, Open Browser GP, that would enable organizations to implement highly-granular secure configurations for their information and operational technology (IT/OT) browsing ecosystem.

J	Shen, F; Liu, ZY; Perigo, L				Shen, Fan; Liu, Zhiyuan; Perigo, Levi			Strategic Monitoring for Efficient Detection of Simultaneous APT Attacks with Limited Resources	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Advanced persistent threats; intrusion detection; LSTM; multi-armed bandit		Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are a type of sophisticated multistage cyber attack, and the defense against APT is challenging. Existing studies apply signature-based or behavior-based methods to analyze monitoring data to detect APT, but little research has been dedicated to the important problem of addressing APT detection with limited resources. In order to maintain the primary functionality of a system, the resources allocated for security purposes, for example logging and examining the behavior of a system, are usually constrained. Therefore, when facing multiple simultaneous powerful cyber attacks like APT, the allocation of limited security resources becomes critical. The research in this paper focuses on the threat model where multiple simultaneous APT attacks exist in the defender's system, but the defender does not have sufficient monitoring resources to check every running process. To capture the footprint of multistage activities including APT attacks and benign activities, this work leverages the provenance graph which is constructed based on dependencies of processes. Furthermore, this work studies the monitoring strategy to efficiently detect APT attacks from incomplete information of paths on the provenance graph, by considering both the "exploitation" effect and the "exploration" effect. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, it extends the classic UCB algorithm in the domain of the multi-armed bandit problem to solve cyber security problems, and proposes to use the malevolence value of a path, which is generated by a novel LSTM neural network as the exploitation term. Second, the consideration of "exploration" is innovative in the detection of APT attacks with limited monitoring resources. The experimental results show that the use of the LSTM neural network is beneficial to enforce the exploitation effect as it satisfies the same property as the exploitation term in the classic UCB algorithm and that by using the proposed monitoring strategy, multiple simultaneous APT attacks are detected more efficiently than using the random strategy and the greedy strategy, regarding the time needed to detect same number of APT attacks.

J	Süzen, AA				Suzen, Ahmet Ali			Developing a multi-level intrusion detection system using hybrid-DBN	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Cyber attack; Deep belief network; Deep neural network; Industrial control system; Intrusion detection system	DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS; LEARNING APPROACH; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; RECOGNITION; ATTACKS; MODEL	In this study, a hybrid deep belief network (DBN) cyber intrusion detection system was proposed to provide a secure network by controlling network traffic in Industrial control systems (ICS). The disadvantages of DBN have been analyzed and improved to create attack detectors in network traffic. The output is combined with Softmax Regression for effective intrusion detection and classification detection. Training and testing of the hybrid DBN model were carried out with the actual and original data set generated by ICS. DBNs are a much-preferred approach for detecting malicious attacks in network traffic. In instances where there is a lot of data, it is important to select the most appropriate structure for the DBN model. Therefore, in the model the hidden layers are updated by contrastive divergence (CD), and the output layer is combined with the Softmax classifier. The proposed model architecture has proved successful in many limitations, such as the complexity and size of training data. The proposed hybrid DBN model provided 99.72% accuracy in intrusion detection and classification. These results showed that the model achieved better performance than the existing intrusion detection system (IDS). It also provided approximately 5% more accuracy improvements with the hybrid model than with older DBN-based systems.

As the technology shows promising applications, many ethical issues also arise. For example, their misuse can enable disinformation campaigns and powerful phishing attempts. Research also shows different biases affect deep learning models, leading to social issues such as misrepresentation. In this work, we formulate a novel setting to deal with similar problems, showing that a repurposed anomaly detection system effectively generates novel data, avoiding generating specified unwanted data. We propose Variational Auto-encoding Binary Classifiers (V-ABC): a novel model that repurposes and extends the Auto-encoding Binary Classifier (ABC) anomaly detector using the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE). We survey the limitations of existing approaches and explore many tools to show the model's inner workings in an interpretable way. This proposal has excellent potential for generative applications: models that rely on user-generated data could automatically filter out unwanted content, such as offensive language, obscene images, and misleading information.

J	Jin, YL; Zhou, JH; Gao, Y				Jin, Yanliang; Zhou, Jiahao; Gao, Yuan			HSGAN-IoT: A hierarchical semi-supervised generative adversarial networks for IoT device classification	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						IoT device classification; Semi-supervised learning; GAN; Hierarchical model; Fusion dataset	DEEP LEARNING APPROACH; TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	In recent years, IoT device classification has become a highly focused issue, because it can achieve network performance optimization, security threat detection, application scenario analysis and device performance evaluation. Existing researches mainly focus on two types of methods: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). However, with the continuous emergence of new devices, ML methods require experts to constantly update and design high -quality features, while DL methods require capturing new data from raw traffic and manually labeling it. These processes are time-consuming and error prone. To solve the problems above, this paper proposes a hierarchical semi -supervised generative adversarial networks for IoT device classification called HSGAN-IoT. HSGAN-IoT proposes a new structure and joint loss to make adversarial training focus on classification tasks instead of generating tasks. Compared to traditional models, HSGAN-IoT classifies a device by three attributes: type, function, and manufacturer. This enables it to classify unknown devices which have not appeared during training. Moreover, HSGAN-IoT avoids redundant calculations through its hierarchical classification structure, which filters out IoT devices from raw traffic data in the first layer and performs further classification in the second layer. This paper also establishes a fusion dataset to test the classification performance of HSGAN-IoT. The results show that HSGAN-IoT is superior to the state-of-the-art researches, with accuracy rates of 99.56%, 96.97%, and 97.86% on three classification tasks, respectively.

The functional advantages of IoV include online communication services, accident prevention, cost reduction, and enhanced traffic regularity. Despite these benefits, IoV technology is susceptible to cyber-attacks, which can exploit vulnerabilities in the vehicle network, leading to perturbations, disturbances, non-recognition of traffic signs, accidents, and vehicle immobilization. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art achievements and developments in applying Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) models for Intrusion Detection Systems in the Internet of Vehicles (IDS-IoV) based on anomaly detection. IDS-IoV leverages anomaly detection through machine learning and DTL techniques to mitigate the risks posed by cyber-attacks. These systems can autonomously create specific models based on network data to differentiate between regular traffic and cyberattacks. Among these techniques, transfer learning models are particularly promising due to their efficacy with DTL models against criteria including the ability to transfer knowledge, detection rate, accurate analysis of complex data, and stability. This review highlights the significant progress made in the field, showcasing how DTL models enhance the performance and reliability of IDS-IoV systems. By examining recent advancements, we provide insights into how DTL can effectively address cyber-attack challenges in IoV environments, ensuring safer and more efficient transportation networks.

PMT has been used extensively in health research, but its application in the field of information security is limited. The study found that threat and coping factors are reliable predictors of employees' motivational behavior towards security. In addition, employee awareness and organizational effort also positively influence threat and coping appraisal processes, leading to cybersecurity behavior. Several practical implications were identified, such as the effectiveness of government organizations in motivating security behavior compared to other businesses. This study provides insights into the complex interplay of factors that shape employees' security behavior and can inform organizations' efforts to promote secure behaviors. (c) 2023 The Authors.

J	Sahoo, SR; Gupta, BB				Sahoo, Somya Ranjan; Gupta, Brij Bhooshan			Classification of various attacks and their defence mechanism in online social networks: a survey	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Online social networking security; Facebook privacy; malware; machine learning; classification	ACCOUNT DETECTION; PRIVACY; SECURITY; MEDIA	Due to the popularity and user friendliness of the Internet, numbers of users of online social networks (OSNs) and social media have grown significantly. However, globally utilised, social networks are the consequence of the lack of understanding of secrecy and protection on OSN and media has increased. Secrecy and surety of OSNs need to be inquired from various positions. According to recent studies, OSN users expose their private information such as email address, phone number etc. In this paper, we have presented a high-level classification of recent OSN attacks for recognising the problem and analysing the blow of such attacks on World Wide Web. We have also discussed OSN attacks on different social networking web applications by citing certain recent reports such as Kaspersky security network and Sophos security threat report. We also offer some simple-to-implement user practice tips to protect the system and user's information. In addition to this, we have discussed a comprehensive analysis of numerous defensive approaches on OSN security. Lastly, based on the acknowledged strength and faults of these defensive approaches, we have explained open research issues.

MitM attacks on internet of things systems take advantage of special features of the protocols and cause system disruptions, making them invisible to legitimate elements. In this work, an intrusion detection system (IDS), where intelligent models can be deployed, is the approach to detect this type of attack considering network alterations. Therefore, this paper presents a novel method to develop the intelligent model used by the IDS, being this method based on a hybrid process. The first stage of the process implements a feature extraction method, while the second one applies different supervised classification techniques, both over a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) dataset compiled by authors in previous works. The contribution shows excellent performance for any compared classification methods. Likewise, the best results are obtained using the method with the highest computational cost. Thanks to this, a functional IDS will be able to prevent MQTT attacks.

J	Yang, G; Zhang, Y; Zhao, LL; Zhang, LM; Zhang, N				Yang, Gang; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Lili; Zhang, Limin; Zhang, Na			EDGE COMPUTING METHOD FOR FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK DETECTION IN ELECTROMECHANICAL TRANSIENT SIMULATION GRID	SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE			English	Article						power grid; electromechanical transient; edge computing; Kalman filtering; LSTM neural network	CLASSIFICATION APPROACH; SMART	Because edge computing is close to the terminal, it has significant advantages of low latency and high-security realtime control and has huge application prospects in the current popular smart grid. Because its edge side is close to the terminal, it can also effectively avoid the risk of information leakage when control instructions or communication data are transmitted to remote cloud center servers over a long distance. However, edge devices have a greater probability of encountering false data injection attacks (FDIAs) from illegal terminals because of their proximity to terminals. The transient electromechanical situation of the smart grid due to FDIAs is analyzed under edge computing. Due to the characteristics that the status values of grid nodes have temporal correlation before and after and spatial correlation between nodes, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for training time series data is selected to predict the status values of grid nodes in advance. The FDIA detection method is also proposed based on the LSTM network. By calculating the predicted value at each historical moment and the root means square error (RMSE) of the system state estimation at that moment, the detection threshold of the scheme is calculated through the cumulative distribution function of RMSE. Simulation experiments are conducted on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)-14 node standard system. The detection rate is as high as 99.71%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed FDIA detection scheme.

ICS are facing new security challenges and are exposed to the same vulnerabilities that plague IT, as demonstrated by the increasing number of incidents targeting ICS. Due to the criticality and unique nature of these systems, it is important to devise novel defense mechanisms that incorporate knowledge of the underlying physical model, and can detect attacks in early phases. To this end, we study a benchmark chemical process, and enumerate the various categories of attack vectors and their practical applicability on hardware controllers in a Hardware-In-The-Loop testbed. Leveraging the observed implications of the categorized attacks on the process, as well as the profile of typical disturbances, we follow a data-driven approach to detect anomalies that are early indicators of malicious activity.

J	Lu, KD; Wu, ZG; Huang, T				Lu, Kang-Di; Wu, Zheng-Guang; Huang, Tingwen			Differential Evolution-Based Three Stage Dynamic Cyber-Attack of Cyber-Physical Power Systems	IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS			English	Article						Constrained differential evolution; cyber-physical power system (CPPS); cyber-physical system (CPS); dynamic attack; state forecasting	DATA INJECTION ATTACKS; LOAD FREQUENCY CONTROL; ALGORITHM	With the rapid development of communication, control, and computer technology, traditional power systems have evolved into cyber-physical power system (CPPS). However, CPPS not only affords convenience but also introduces more cyber-attacks. Among many types of cyber-attacks, false data injection attacks (FDIAs) have drawn much attention in the CPPS security domain due to their stealthiness. Most FDIAs are based on the static model on a single snapshot and often ignore the reality of dynamically time-evolving CPPS. Accordingly, this article proposes a novel three-stage dynamic false data injection attack (DFDIA) model in CPPS by considering potential dynamic behaviors. To consider both attack location and attack amplitude, the designing DFDIA is formulated as two constrained single-objective optimization problems. Two versions of constrained differential evolution are presented as the solver to determine the attack location and optimize the attack vector for collaboratively altering the meter measurements. Then, an interval state forecasting-based countermeasure is proposed to detect the established DFDIA. In this detector, the variation bounds of state values are determined via ensemble deep learning-based state forecasting method. Finally, extensive simulation results on several IEEE bus systems demonstrate the feasibility of DFDIA and the effectiveness of the defense mechanism.

The framework, rigorously tested within a simulated environment modeled after Texas' ERCOT region, focuses on exposing and exploiting vulnerabilities in hybrid hydrogen-power networks. The initial surveillance stage employs CNNs to analyze network data, identifying critical susceptibilities in the storage, production, and distribution systems-pinpointing 30 key bus lines that exhibit increased risk factors. This stage achieves subtle manipulations causing load variations between 5 and 10 %, designed to evade detection while assessing system responses. Following this, the intensification stage leverages Double DQN to refine and escalate the attack's intensity, targeting 50 bus lines during peak load periods, enhancing the precision of disruptions without detection. The culmination is a full-scale offensive, dynamically and aggressively assaulting the network, achieving a peak disruption of 40 % across targeted components while maintaining operational secrecy. This comprehensive strategy not only demonstrates the catastrophic potential of cyberattacks on critical energy infrastructure but also highlights significant vulnerabilities, particularly in hybrid energy storage systems, providing crucial insights for strengthening cybersecurity measures. The empirical findings from our simulations suggest that without robust security enhancements, hybrid energy networks are at risk of operational disruptions that could exceed 40 % of their capacity during peak times, underscoring the urgent need for advanced detection and mitigation strategies.

One of the most critical attack for cyber security and serious security threat to Internet services in recent years is Denial of Service (DoS). Therefore, using machine learning techniques along traditional security mechanisms such as firewall and cryptography, can improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). This research paper introduces an approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on Viterbi algorithm for detecting anomalies on SNMP MIB dataset, and compares it to two classification algorithms: Adaboost M1 and Naive Bayes algorithm. The obtained results show HMM based on Viterbi algorithm found effective and achieved great results in detecting the attacks with a high detection rate.

J	Moustafa, N; Misra, G; Slay, J				Moustafa, Nour; Misra, Gaurav; Slay, Jill			Generalized Outlier Gaussian Mixture Technique Based on Automated Association Features for Simulating and Detecting Web Application Attacks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Data mining; Data models; Phishing; Blacklisting; Web application attacks; threat intelligence; gaussian mixture model; outlier detection; cyber simulation	BIG DATA ANALYTICS; ANOMALY DETECTION; CYBER SECURITY; SYSTEMS	Web application attacks constitute considerable security threats to computer networks and end users. Existing threat detection methods are mostly designed on signature-based approaches which cannot recognize zero-day vulnerabilities. Moreover, with the minimal availability of real-world web attack data, the effectiveness of such approaches is limited further. In this paper, we propose an architectural scheme for designing a threat intelligence technique for web attacks to address these challenges through a four-step methodology: 1) collecting web attack data by crawling websites and accumulating network traffic for representing this data as feature vectors; 2) dynamically extracting important features using the Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorithm; 3 ) using these extracted features to simulate web attack data; and 4) proposing a new Outlier Gaussian Mixture (OGM) technique for detecting known as well as zero-day attacks based on the anomaly detection methodology. The performance of the scheme is appraised using two well-known datasets, namely, the Web Attack and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms four other competing machine learning mechanisms in terms of detection rate and false alarm rates on both the original as well as simulated web data.

J	Charmet, F; Morikawa, T; Takahashi, T				Charmet, Fabien; Morikawa, Tomohiro; Takahashi, Takeshi			Toward a Better Understanding of Mobile Users' Behavior: A Web Session Repair Scheme	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Maintenance engineering; Security; History; Data collection; Behavioral sciences; Smart phones; Phishing; Cyberattack; Mobile security; machine learning; data collection; attack detection		Using mobile devices to browse the Internet has become increasingly popular over the years. However, the risk of being exposed to malicious content, such as online scams or malware installations, has also increased significantly. In this study, we collected smartphone data from volunteer users by monitoring their use of the Web and the applications they install on their devices. However, the collected data is sometimes incomplete due to the technical limitations of mobile devices. Thus, we propose a data repair scheme to restore incomplete data by inferring missing attributes. Here, the restored data represent the browsing history of a mobile user, which can be used to determine if and how the user has been the victim of web or mobile-specific attacks to compromise their sensitive data. The accuracy of the proposed data repair scheme was evaluated using a machine learning algorithm, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme properly reconstructed a user's browsing history data with an accuracy of 95%. The usability of the repaired data is demonstrated by a practical use case. The user's browsing history was correlated with other types of data, such as received SMSs and the applications installed by the user. The results demonstrate that a user can fall victim to SMS-based phishing (SMShing) attacks, where the attacker sends an SMS message to a user to trick them install a malicious application. We also present a case of a social engineering attack, where the victim was manipulated to provide their Amazon credentials and credit card details.

J	Alsirhani, A; Sampalli, S; Bodorik, P				Alsirhani, Amjad; Sampalli, Srinivas; Bodorik, Peter			DDoS Detection System: Using a Set of Classification Algorithms Controlled by Fuzzy Logic System in Apache Spark	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						DDoS attack; DDoS detection; fuzzy logic system; machine learning; classification algorithms; apache spark; apache Hadoop; cloud computing	TREES	Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a major security threat against the availability of conventional or cloud computing resources. Numerous DDoS attacks, which have been launched against various organizations in the last decade, have had a direct impact on both vendors and users. Many researchers have attempted to tackle the security threat of DDoS attacks by combining classification algorithms with distributed computing. However, their solutions are static in terms of the classification algorithms used. In fact, current DDoS attacks have become so dynamic and sophisticated that they are able to pass the detection system thereby making it difficult for static solutions to detect. In this paper, we propose a dynamic DDoS attack detection system based on three main components: 1) classification algorithms; 2) a distributed system; and 3) a fuzzy logic system. Our framework uses fuzzy logic to dynamically select an algorithm from a set of prepared classification algorithms that detect different DDoS patterns. Out of the many candidate classification algorithms, we use Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (Entropy), Decision Tree (Gini), and Random Forest as candidate algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of classification algorithms and their delays and validated the fuzzy logic system. We have also evaluated the effectiveness of the distributed system and its impact on the classification algorithms delay. The results show that there is a trade-off between the utilized classification algorithms' accuracies and their delays. We observe that the fuzzy logic system can effectively select the right classification algorithm based on the traffic status.

This is particularly the case when a threat is based on deception of the user rather than exploitation of a specific technical flaw, as is the case of spear-phishing, application spoofing, multimedia masquerading and other semantic social engineering attacks. Here, we put the concept of the human-as-a-security-sensor to the test with a first case study on a small number of participants subjected to different attacks in a controlled laboratory environment and provided with a mechanism to report these attacks if they spot them. A key challenge is to estimate the reliability of each report, which we address with a machine learning approach. For comparison, we evaluate the ability of known technical security countermeasures in detecting the same threats. This initial proof of concept study shows that the concept is viable.

Despite their impacts on hardware security, existing DL-based SCA attacks have not fully leveraged the potential of DL algorithms. Therefore, previously proposed DL-based SCA attacks may not show the real capability to extract sensitive information from target designs. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-device SCA method, named Dual-Leak, that applies Deep Unsupervised Active Learning to create a DL model for breaking cryptographic implementations, even with countermeasures deployed. The experimental results on both the local dataset and publicly available dataset show that our Dual-Leak attack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works while no labeled traces are required from victim devices (i.e., unsupervised learning). Countermeasures are also discussed to assure hardware security against new attacks.

The technique for cyber attack sequences modeling and testing using source data from the MITRE ATT&CK database and the production model is proposed. Risk assessment is implemented for the generated cyber attack sequences, analysed information system components and an information system as a whole using risks decomposition and Common Vulnerability Scoring System metrics. The developed techniques for cyber attack sequences modeling and risks assessment are implemented within the software tool. The tool also allows recommending possible countermeasures for the successful attack sequences using MITRE ATT& CK data. The experiments for different infrastructures are conducted and application of the developed tool is demonstrated on the case study.

The proposed control schemes are designed based on classic-intelligent control strategies for trajectory tracking and vibration control of a networked control system, which are developed for tip angular position control, while the system is prone to cyber attacks. The malicious attacks are assumed to be of denial of service (DoS) kind and cause packet loss with high probability in the two signals; control input and sensor output. In this paper, several classic and intelligent control strategies are studied in terms of robustness and effectiveness to attacks. Based on the results, a new hybrid control scheme is designed using linear quadratic regulation, sliding mode control, and artificial radial basis function neural network to alleviate the effect of DoS attacks and maintain the performance of the cyber-rotary gantry system in tracking applications. The neural network controller is trained during the control process. Its learning algorithm is based on the minimization of a cost function which contains the sliding surface. The hybrid control system is analyzed from the stability perspective. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed scheme is validated by simulation on MATLAB Simulink platform.

However, the previous studies of deep voice detection are still insufficient when applied to actual crime prevention services. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new framework called "DevoX" that can apply deep voice detection to actual services. This framework continually trains on voice data from end devices (such as smartphones) for new types of deep voice crimes. Also, DevoX provides low-latency services through the core-edge cloud architecture. Edge cloud sends extracted features through encoding instead of call voice to prevent privacy leaks. It is possible to apply deep voice detection technology to actual services. Therefore, our study can be effectively utilized in preventing phishing based on deep voice.

This re-training process creates a loophole and poses a security threat for ML systems. Adversaries leverage this loophole and design data poisoning attacks against ML systems. Data poisoning attacks are a type of attack in which an adversary manipulates the training dataset to degrade the ML system's performance. Data poisoning attacks are challenging to detect, and even more difficult to respond to, particularly in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. To address this problem, we proposed DISTINICT, the first proactive data poisoning attack detection framework using distance measures. We found that Jaccard Distance (JD) can be used in the DISTINICT (among other distance measures) and we finally improved the JD to attain an Optimized JD(OJD) with lower time and space complexity. Our security analysis shows that the DISTINICT is secure against data poisoning attacks by considering key features of adversarial attacks. We conclude that the proposed OJD-based DISTINICT is effective and efficient against data poisoning attacks where in-time detection is critical for IoT applications with large volumes of streaming data.

Since huge data management is involved, maintaining the time constraints between the devices in IoT networks is another significant issue. To address these issues, an intelligent intrusion detection system has been adapted to recognize or predict a cyber-attack using Elite Machine Learning algorithms (EML), and a lightweight protocol is used to manage the time-constrained issue. The experimental analysis of work is done on a testbed setup with the hardware and sensors connected using a lightweight Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This comprises three parts: (i) collection of data with the help of a sensor for three different scenarios called SEN-MQTTSET; (ii) multi-context feature generation using an ensemble statistical multi-view cascade feature generation algorithm from the SEN-MQTTSET dataset; and (iii) evaluating the dataset using ML algorithms. The SEN-MQTTSET dataset has been created from the three scenarios, such as normal, attack on a subscriber, and attack on a broker. The multi-context feature is generated from the raw dataset using an ensemble statistical multi-view cascade feature generation algorithm. The EML is proposed to select the best model for intrusion detection among ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Naive Bias, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree by the performance metrics such as accuracy, prediction time, F1-score, and others. The proposed dataset is validated and the accuracy is found to be above 99% for the considered system model. Different quality parameters have been carried out for legitimate and attack traffic features to calculate the delay between the IoT-MQTT network.

Meanwhile, spatio-temporal correlation manifests significantly between different components in a smart grid making the spiking neural network a desirable candidate for false data injection attack detection. In this paper, we develop a spiking-neural-network-based technique for dynamic cyber-attack detection in a smart grid. This is achieved through judiciously integrating spiking neurons with a special recurrent neural network called the delayed feedback reservoir computing. The inter-spike interval encoding is also explored in the precise-spike-driven synaptic plasticity based training process. The simulation results suggest that the introduced method outperforms multi-layer perceptrons and can achieve a significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the delay value in the delayed feedback reservoir will have a substantial impact on the overall system performance.

Moreover, APT groups are becoming more sophisticated and organised which needs to be addressed by the research community to enable faster response and more importantly, prevent threats within the domain. The MITRE ATT&CK Cloud framework offers one of the leading structured inventories within this context. Our research is to expose patterns and signatures of a select group of APT's on the MITRE Cloud Framework by using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to construct a "lattice graph" and an ontology. The goal is to develop a better conceptualisation of the MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix framework for cyber security experts to be able to proactively act upon adversary techniques. The MITRE ATT&CK framework was retrieved, cleaned, and pre-processed to construct the lattice and ontology using data cleaning methods, FCA tools such as Concept Explorer, and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), with additional symbolic reasoning and inference generation. This resulted in knowledge representations/graphs, which are highly efficient representations of this knowledge field. The underlying linkages between techniques and targets specific to those APTs are further exposed and enriched and presented visually and integrated into the ontology. The ontology gives formalisation to associations and implications between techniques, tactics, and APTs - enabling cyber security practitioners to forecast potential targets and techniques based on their scenario, but also to attribute certain technique patterns and signatures to individual APTs. Cyber security practitioners can query from this knowledge graph and formulate strategic proactive measures. From these findings, the applications and constraints of the APTs' cyber-attack techniques and their associated patterns were determined. The findings provide a guideline for future additional research in the field of AI knowledge representation in cybersecurity, as well as highlighting certain limitations in this field of research.

This study presents an enhanced version of DomainLynx, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting domain squatting. We introduce novel techniques that combine LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to identify a wide range of squatting tactics, including complex hybrid methods that merge multiple deception techniques. Our improved system features refined detection algorithms and an advanced validation process that significantly reduces false positives while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations using various LLM configurations demonstrate DomainLynx's superior performance. Using a state-of-the-art LLM, the system achieved 94.7% accuracy on a diverse dataset of 1,649 squatting domains. In a month-long real-world test, DomainLynx detected 34,359 potential squatting domains from 2.09 million new registrations, outperforming existing methods by 2.5 times. Further analysis confirmed the system's effectiveness across different squatting types. We also present case studies of hybrid-squatting domains, such as those combining typos with brand impersonation, offering insights into emerging threats. This research advances Internet security by providing a more accurate, adaptable, and thoroughly evaluated LLM-based tool for combating evolving domain squatting threats, contributing to safer online environments for users and organizations worldwide.

On the Resiliency of Power and Gas Integration Resources Against Cyber Attacks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural gas; Power grids; Optimal scheduling; Informatics; Indexes; Job shop scheduling; Cybersecurity; integrated power and natural gas transmission grid; scheduling; system capacity expansion	CONSTRAINED OPTIMAL POWER; NATURAL-GAS; SECURITY; DEEP; COMMUNICATION; ELECTRICITY; SYSTEMS	Integration of power and gas systems has been recently proposed as a portfolio solution to deal with the sporadic availability of renewables and enhance the flexibility of power systems. In an integrated system, where critical operating information and control signals of both systems need to be communicated, the risk of cyber attack is intensified. In this article, we present a new model for the integration of power and gas systems using power-to-gas (PtG) and gas-fired generation (GfG) facilities. We demonstrate how the operation of the integrated system can be adversely impacted during cyber attacks that may not be detected using traditional methods. We propose two new detection schemes for false data injection attacks against the input and output signals of the PtG/GfG facility scheduler. In the first scheme, a supervised machine-learning technique, based on the convolutional neural network and wavelet transforms, is adopted to detect attacks on the information received by the facility scheduler. In the second scheme, a hybrid neural network is developed, based on an unsupervised learning technique, that requires no labeled training information to detect attacks on the output control signals issued by the scheduler. In both schemes, information acquired from local sensors and deterministic estimation methods is utilized for signal evaluation. The proposed schemes are incorporated into the facilities' scheduler to create a cyber-attack resilient scheduling model in an integrated power and gas grid. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are evaluated via numerical studies using the IEEE30-bus power system integrated with the Belgian gas grid as the test bed using historical operating parameters.

The flexibility of these services has attracted unethical individuals, so-called "spammers", aiming at spreading malicious, phishing, and misleading information. Unfortunately, the existence of spam results non-ignorable problems related to search and user's privacy. In the battle of fighting spam, various detection methods have been designed, which work by automating the detection process using the "features" concept combined with machine learning methods. However, the existing features are not effective enough to adapt spammers' tactics due to the ease of manipulation in the features. Also, the graph features are not suitable for Twitter based applications, though the high performance obtainable when applying such features. In this paper, beyond the simple statistical features such as number of hashtags and number of URLs, we examine the time property through advancing the design of some features used in the literature, and proposing new time based features. The new design of features is divided between robust advanced statistical features incorporating explicitly the time attribute, and behavioral features identifying any posting behavior pattern. The experimental results show that the new form of features is able to classify correctly the majority of spammers with an accuracy higher than 93% when using Random Forest learning algorithm, applied on a collected and annotated data-set. The results obtained outperform the accuracy of the state of the art features by about 6%, proving the significance of leveraging time in detecting spam accounts.

Each of these citizens needs to prove their identity to fulfil their day-to-day routine. In this current digital revolution whole world is transforming to digitalization. Therefore, proving someone's identity in the digital space is a must. Being able to track a person digitally can eliminate identity theft and most incidents related to online harassment. With the focus on data privacy and security of citizens, we have proposed "Trust Pass": Cyber Security Intelligence-based trusted digital identity platform capable of registering and verifying service providers based on document validation neural network model (95.4% accuracy) and allowing citizens to authenticate themselves to service providers with three-factor biometrics authentication with liveness detection neural network model (99.8% accuracy). The requests of the whole system are secured with Cyber Security Threat Intelligence System, and unusual activities of users are monitored through Informative Data Analytics Engine. All the sensitive user data is saved using a blockchain to ensure user privacy while reducing the system's vulnerability.

Emails can be transmitted digitally without the adequate au-thentication of the sender. As a result, there has been a considerable surge in security threats coming from email communication, such as phishing, spear phishing, whaling, and malware deposition through emails where recipients can be duped into acting. Authorship assertion of the sender can prevent several security issues, particularly in an organizational setting where an em-ployee's trust can be compromised by faking an email from a colleague or senior without exposing any specific system weakness. A psychometric ap-proach to determining the authorship of an email in an organization is pro-posed in this research. Machine learning (ML) models have been developed using four classification algorithms. The performance of these ML models has been compared.

In order for a successful handling of this situation, it is crucial to have a prediction of cyber attacks, appropriate precautions, and effective utilization of cyber intelligence that enables these actions. Malicious hackers share various kinds of information through particular communities such as the dark web, indicating that a great deal of intelligence exists in cyberspace. This paper focuses on forums on the dark web and proposes an approach to extract forums which include important information or intelligence from huge amounts of forums and identify traits of each forum using methodologies such as machine learning, natural language processing and so on.

Authorship mechanism based on the analysis of the author's writing style and implemented through binary traditional and deep learning classifiers is applied to build the email verification mechanism. A flexible architecture, where the authorship component can be placed in different locations, is proposed. Due to its location and consequently to the email data available, can be exploited an individual writing style, or an end to end writing style learning related to the sender-receiver communication. The system is validated on two different dataset (i) the well-known public Enron dataset, with the experiments showing the author verification accuracy of 96.5% and 99% respectively for the individual and end to end writing style learning and (ii) our private dataset, with accuracy results of 98.3% and 97%. An alternative classification training, that exploits the partition of the dataset in subsets having approximately the same length, is presented. From the results obtained is proved how such training approach outperforms the traditional training where emails of different lengths are contained in the same training dataset. The overall results obtained proved that the authorship mechanism proposed is a promising alternative support technique exploitable as an email anti-scam or anti-theft tool to guarantee secure email communication.

C	Akaishi, S; Uda, R			IEEE	Akaishi, Sota; Uda, Ryuya			Classification of XSS Attacks by Machine Learning with Frequency of Appearance and Co-occurrence	2019 53RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCES AND SYSTEMS (CISS)			English	Proceedings Paper	53rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	MAR 20-22, 2019	Baltimore, MD					Cross site scripting (XSS) attack is one of the attacks on the web. It brings session hijack with HTTP cookies, information collection with fake HTML input form and phishing with dummy sites. As a countermeasure of XSS attack, machine learning has attracted a lot of attention. There are existing researches in which SVM, Random Forest and SCW are used for the detection of the attack. However, in the researches, there are problems that the size of data set is too small or unbalanced, and that preprocessing method for vectorization of strings causes misclassification. The highest accuracy of the classification was 98% in existing researches. Therefore, in this paper, we improved the preprocessing method for vectorization by using word2vec to find the frequency of appearance and co-occurrence of the words in XSS attack scripts. Moreover, we also used a large data set to decrease the deviation of the data. Furthermore, we evaluated the classification results with two procedures. One is an inappropriate procedure which some researchers tend to select by mistake. The other is an appropriate procedure which can be applied to an attack detection filter in the real environment.

Autoencoder Based FDI Attack Detection Scheme For Smart Grid Stability	2022 IEEE 19TH INDIA COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, INDICON	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE-India-Council International Conference (INDICON)	NOV 24-26, 2022	Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Kochi, INDIA		Cochin Univ Sci & Technol	False Data Injection (FDI); Autoencoders (AE's); False Data Injection Attack (FDIA); Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)	DATA INJECTION ATTACKS; STATE ESTIMATION	One of the major concerns in the real-time monitoring systems in a smart grid is the Cyber security threat. The false data injection attack is emerging as a major form of attack in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A False data Injection Attack (FDIA) can lead to severe issues like insufficient generation, physical damage to the grid, power flow imbalance as well as economical loss. The recent advancements in machine learning algorithms have helped solve the drawbacks of using classical detection techniques for such attacks. In this article, we propose to use Autoencoders (AE's) as a novel Machine Learning approach to detect FDI attacks without any major modifications. The performance of the method is validated through the analysis of the simulation results. The algorithm achieves optimal accuracy owing to the unsupervised nature of the algorithm.

Most control systems offer entry-points for malicious users to disrupt their functionality severely, which is unacceptable when they are part of the national critical infrastructure. Cyber-resilience, i.e., the ability of a system to sustain - possibly malicious - alterations while maintaining an acceptable functionality, is recognized as one of the keys to understand how much damage can be brought to a system and its surrounding environment in case of a successful cyber-attack. In this paper we compare methods to assess resilience considering both concrete simulation and symbolic simulation. Our ultimate goal is to provide maintainers and other stakeholders with a dynamic and quantitative measure of cyber-resilience. Here we present some results on a case study related to waste-water treatment, in order to provide initial evidence that concrete and symbolic simulation can be used in a complementary way to analyze the security of industrial control systems.

While recent research on smart phone platforms has shown that motion/vibration sensors inbuilt in these phones also pose a keylogging threat, this line of attack has never been investigated in desktop and laptop settings given that no such sensors exist in these settings. In this paper, we show that the vibration dynamics of commonly used computer table materials transmit keyboard vibrations during typing with such fine granularity that keyboard typing locations (and hence keystrokes) could be learned from the vibrations. In practice such an attack would be executed by methodically rigging the underside of a computer table or keyboard itself with a series of motion sensors, and then mining the data generated by these sensors during typing. Taking the case of typical computer table materials such as glass, plastic, metal and wood, we study this line of attack and highlight scenarios where it poses a potent threat. Thanks to fast growing IoT platforms making available easy-to-use, fully featured, cheap sensors, we argue that this line of attack is accessible to even casual "computer hackers" having no knowledge of low-level hardware programming.

Nuclear forensics helps trace the illicit trafficking of radioactive materials. The present study develops the methods for the forensics of the possible origins of fuels irradiated in nuclear reactors, which are the most powerful sources producing radioactive materials, including plutonium. Three key factors are significant for irradiated fuel forensics, namely, initial 235U enrichment, burnup, and the type of irradiation nuclear reactors. The methods for the first two are determined based on experimental data of six nuclear-reactor technologies and are further verified using the neutron-transport-depletion cou-pling simulation of the two major commercial reactor technologies, a pressurized-water reactor (PWR) and a boiling-water reactor (BWR). In addition, three machine-learning techniques are applied to discrim-inate between a PWR and a BWR, which are quite similar in neutronic properties, with nice accuracy and generalization ability. In summary, the presently determined methods provide a reliable pathway to predict the origins of spent nuclear fuels.

C	Mottaleb, A; Canan, M			ACAD CONF LTD	Mottaleb, Ayman; Canan, Mustafa			Analyzing the Cyberattacks Sponsored by State-Actors Under the Contemporary Global Political and Legal Frameworks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY (ICCWS 2021)	International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ICCWS)	FEB 25-26, 2021	Tennessee Tech Univ, ELECTR NETWORK		Tennessee Tech Univ	cyberwarfare; cyberattack; cyberlaw; international law; cybersecurity; information system		There is disagreement on whether the state-sponsored cyber-attack should be considered an act of war or mere crimes; even with the view that advocates that cyber-attack is a crime, there is no consensus on whether these acts should be subjected to international or national jurisdictions. Regardless of this methodical schism between the two sides on the nature of the cyberspace attacks, there is almost unanimity in the Western school of thought that using cyberspace as a vehicle to attack other nations maliciously violates both national and international laws. Nearly every nation has incorporated its criminal procedures to extradite a suspect of a crime to stand trial. Almost no law states explicitly that a suspect of a cyber-attack can be extradited. However, it is implied among most jurists that the legal concept of extradition should include the extradition of a suspect of cyber-crimes to face prosecution. Assuming that national laws implement robust legal frameworks to combat cross-borders cyberattacks, these laws' enforceability still constitutes a practical problem. In fact, many victim countries cannot extend their arms to pursue and seek extradition of foreign nationals to be brought into justice at another sovereign state. Indeed, the only way to fix this dilemma is through a uniformed international legal system with universal protection. The researchers analyzed primary resources in policies, sociopolitical, and national and international laws. Therefore, they suggest that cyber-defensive measures confer with the non-violence standards founded on international law. Consequently, it is concluded that the current international legal frameworks uphold the right of a state that was subject to cyberattacks to counter the attack using cyberspace or traditional forces to prevent and deter future imminent attacks. Finally, this work's findings delineate the need for interdisciplinary work investigating the realms of Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Comparative Law. This research uses qualitative methodology to compare and analyze the current U.S. and international socio-political and legal frameworks that govern cyber-attacks. The existing legal and policy frameworks support the notion that malicious cyberattacks on states' political or business infrastructures violate national and international laws' sovereignty and self-determination principles.

J	Francis, GT; Souri, A; Inanç, N				Francis, Georg Thamer; Souri, Alireza; Inanc, Nihat			A hybrid intrusion detection approach based on message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol in industrial internet of things	TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								The number of attacks against Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has increased over the past years, particularly on widely used communication protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transfer (MQTT). The fast increase in IIoT applications brings both critical challenges and technical gaps in cybersecurity. On the other hand, traditional cyber-attack detection approaches scrap to address and support the run-time responsibilities of IIoT environments. This study presents a hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Random Forest (GA_RF) method for detecting cyber-attacks in Industrial Control Machines (ICS) that use MQTT protocol in the IIoT environment. This architecture integrates ICS with edge devices and cloud servers, using a GA_RF algorithm to detect anomalies in data collected by sensors. Normal data is processed locally and then sent to the cloud for storage and return, ensuring continuous monitoring and security. Also, the MQTT-IOT-IDS2020 dataset as a real test case was applied for prediction of the proposed GA_RF method with compare to some other powerful machine and deep learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed GA_RF method has an optimum accuracy of 99.87%-100% for detecting cyber-attacks. This hybrid algorithm also achieved 0-0.0015 in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 100% in Precision, Recall, and F-score factors. This result led to the proposed architecture, which connects the ICS to a server while running GA_RF on the IIoT environment. In conclusion, this study indicates the effectiveness of GA_RF and aims to improve security by using the MQTT protocol in IIoT.

The techniques employed by these groups are evolving daily, becoming more complex and sophisticated. Their attacks leverage multiple vulnerabilities to evade our detection networks and have complex operational behaviors, making analysis extremely challenging. Therefore, security personnel require a response system that can analyze complex threat landscape easily and detect threats precisely. We describe the complex threat landscape considering heterogeneous Indicators of Compromise(IOCs) and predict future scenarios. This paper presents cases of searching for similar homogenous IOCs and predicting the relationships between heterogeneous IOCs. Through our work, analysts can effortlessly gain knowledge about the threat landscape. Additionally, we design an AI(Artificial Intelligence) model that considers the interdependent relationships between IOCs to identify attack groups. Our approach has shown better performance than traditional AI classification methods and graph-based classification methods.

Perhaps the most damaging aspect of spam email is that it has become such a major tool for attacks of cross-site scripting, malware infection, phishing, and cross-site request forgery, etc. Due to the nature of the adaptive unsolicited spam, it has been weakening the effect of the previous discovery techniques. This article proposes a new Spam Detection System (SDS) framework, by using a series of six different variants of enhanced Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (EGOAs), which are investigated and combined with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the purpose of advanced spam email detection. In this context, the combination of MLP and EGOAs produces Neural Network (NN) models, referred to (EGOAMLPs). The main idea of this research is to use EGOAs to train the MLP to classify the emails as spam and non-spam. These models are applied to SpamBase, SpamAssassin, and UK-2011 Webspam benchmark datasets. In this way, the effectiveness of our models on detecting diverse forms of spam email is evidenced. The results showed that the proposed MLP model trained by EGOAs achieves a higher performance compared to other optimization methods in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and false alarm rate.

J	Javed, A; Burnap, P; Rana, O				Javed, Amir; Burnap, Pete; Rana, Omer			Prediction of drive-by download attacks on Twitter	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cyber security; Drive-by download; Malware; Machine learning; Web security	EFFICIENT; URLS	The popularity of Twitter for information discovery, coupled with the automatic shortening of URLs to save space, given the 140 character limit, provides cybercriminals with an opportunity to obfuscate the URL of a malicious Web page within a tweet. Once the URL is obfuscated, the cybercriminal can lure a user to click on it with enticing text and images before carrying out a cyber attack using a malicious Web server. This is known as a drive-by download. In a drive-by download a user's computer system is infected while interacting with the malicious endpoint, often without them being made aware the attack has taken place. An attacker can gain control of the system by exploiting unpatched system vulnerabilities and this form of attack currently represents one of the most common methods employed. In this paper we build a machine learning model using machine activity data and tweet metadata to move beyond post-execution classification of such URLs as malicious, to predict a URL will be malicious with 0.99 F-measure (using 10-fold cross-validation) and 0.833 (using an unseen test set) at 1 s into the interaction with the URL. Thus, providing a basis from which to kill the connection to the server before an attack has completed and proactively blocking and preventing an attack, rather than reacting and repairing at a later date.

Trust-Based Detection and Mitigation of Cyber Attacks in Distributed Cooperative Control of Islanded AC Microgrids	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						cyber attack mitigation; trust values; microgrid resilience; KL divergence; IEEE-34 bus feeder system	SECURITY; SYSTEMS	In this study, we address the challenge of detecting and mitigating cyber attacks in the distributed cooperative control of islanded AC microgrids, with a particular focus on detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), a significant threat to the Smart Grid (SG). The SG integrates traditional power systems with communication networks, creating a complex system with numerous vulnerable links, making it a prime target for cyber attacks. These attacks can lead to the disclosure of private data, control network failures, and even blackouts. Unlike machine learning-based approaches that require extensive datasets and mathematical models dependent on accurate system modeling, our method is free from such dependencies. To enhance the microgrid's resilience against these threats, we propose a resilient control algorithm by introducing a novel trustworthiness parameter into the traditional cooperative control algorithm. Our method evaluates the trustworthiness of distributed energy resources (DERs) based on their voltage measurements and exchanged information, using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to dynamically adjust control actions. We validated our approach through simulations on both the IEEE-34 bus feeder system with eight DERs and a larger microgrid with twenty-two DERs. The results demonstrated a detection accuracy of around 100%, with millisecond range mitigation time, ensuring rapid system recovery. Additionally, our method improved system stability by up to almost 100% under attack scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in promptly detecting attacks and maintaining system resilience. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to enhance the security and stability of microgrid systems in the face of cyber threats.

J	Shen, YP; Zheng, KF; Wu, CH; Yang, YX				Shen, Yanping; Zheng, Kangfeng; Wu, Chunhua; Yang, Yixian			A Nature-inspired Multiple Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Model for Intrusion Detection	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Meta-heuristics; Kernel extreme learning machine; Multiple kernel learning; Intrusion detection	FEATURE-SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; ALIGNMENT	The application of machine learning (ML) in intrusion detection has attracted much attention with the rapid growth of information security threat. As an efficient multi-label classifier, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) has been gradually used in intrusion detection system. However, the performance of KELM heavily relies on the kernel selection. In this paper, a novel multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) model combining the ReliefF with nature-inspired methods is proposed for intrusion detection. The MKELM is designed to estimate whether the attack is carried out and the ReliefF is used as a preprocessor of MKELM to select appropriate features. In addition, the nature-inspired methods whose fitness functions are defined based on the kernel alignment are employed to build the optimal composite kernel in the MKELM. The KDD99, NSL and Kyoto datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimal composite kernel function can be determined by using any heuristic optimization method, including PSO, GA, GWO, BA and DE. Since the filter-based feature selection method is combined with the multiple kernel learning approach independent of the classifier, the proposed model can have a good performance while saving a lot of training time.

J	Verma, S; Muttoo, SK				Verma, Sushma; Muttoo, S. K.			An Android Malware Detection Framework-based on Permissions and Intents	DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Permissions; intents; pruning; clustering; classification		With an exponential growth in smartphone applications targeting useful services such as banks, healthcare, m-commerce, security has become a primary concern. The applications downloaded from unofficial sources pose a security threat as they lack mechanisms for validation of the applications. The malware infected applications may lead to several threats such as leaking user's private information, enforcing malicious deductions for sending premium SMS, getting root privilege of the android system and so on. Existing anti-viruses depend on signature databases that need to be updated from time to time and are unable to detect zero-day malware. The Android Operating system allows inter-application communication through the use of component reuse by using intents. Unfortunately, message passing is also an application attack surface. A hybrid method for android malware detection by analysing the permissions and intent-filters of the manifest files of the applications is presented. A malware detection framework is developed based on machine learning algorithms and on the basis of the decision tree obtained from ID3 and J48 classifiers available in WEKA. Both algorithms gave same results with an error percentage of 6 per cent. The system improves detection of zero day malware.	[Verma, Sushma] Sci Anal Grp, Delhi 110054, India; [Muttoo, S.

The development of robust deepfake detection algorithm is booming in recent years. However, the existing works require many face images for model training and the frontal face images collection would have privacy concerns. Therefore, this privacy issue inspires our research work that a deepfake detection model is trained from photos with face mask. We found that training a deepfake detection model from photos with face mask is rarely discussed in the literature. In order to resolve the challenges from face mask, we incorporate sub-regions (e.g., eye, nose, jaw) in a face during the training process. In addition to the extension by including facial sub-regions, we found that the associate training strategy is another important design factor for performance improvement. Our method improved the result significantly and the AUC of FaceForensics++ (FF++) test dataset evaluation is increased from 87.67% to 98.93%. As a result, we can develop a promising deepfake detection model even from the photos with face mask. We expected this work can be a stepping stone to inspire more research works with privacy considerations.

End-user needs, human factors, high ethical standards, and social impacts can best be adapted when professionals from different fields work together with end-users to refine and co-develop selected tools into a platform. A resilience assessment that combines BCM and CTI enables 1) quick or detailed assessment of the investigated industry and its critical processes, 2) measurement of performance goals based on information received from end users, where artificial intelligence-based self-learning approaches can be used for functional descriptions, 3) information on the sensitivity of the investigated industry and vulnerability and 4) resilience and BCM throughout the entire resilience cycle. A new Horizon Europe project DYNAMO (Dynamic Resilience Assessment Method including a combined Business Continuity Management and Cyber Threat Intelligence solution for Critical Sectors) works towards combining BCM and CTI to generate a situational picture for decision support. Having this in mind, certain cybersecurity and BCM tools will be developed, refined, and integrated into the DYNAMO platform to provide decision support and awareness to chief information security officers, cybersecurity practitioners, and other stakeholders. This paper reports a case study that explores how combining CTI and BCM can help in the case of a cyber-attack. The research material consists of the news articles by the largest newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat (HS) of how the cyber attack against the therapy center Vastaamo progressed during the first week after the attack. The results show that cyber threat intelligence when flexibly integrated into the BCM approach could create better conditions for improved organizational foresight to react to unpredictable cyber threats to ensure business continuity.

The training of speaker verification requires a large amount of data, therefore users usually need to adopt third-party data (e.g., data from the Internet or third-party data company). This raises the question of whether adopting untrusted third-party data can pose a security threat. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to inject the hidden backdoor for infecting speaker verification models by poisoning the training data. Specifically, we design a clustering-based attack scheme where poisoned samples from different clusters will contain different triggers (i.e., pre-defined utterances), based on our understanding of verification tasks. The infected models behave normally on benign samples, while attacker-specified unenrolled triggers will successfully pass the verification even if the attacker has no information about the enrolled speaker. We also demonstrate that existing backdoor attacks cannot be directly adopted in attacking speaker verification. Our approach not only provides a new perspective for designing novel attacks, but also serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of verification methods. The code for reproducing main results is available at https.//github.com/zhaitongqing233/Backdoor-attack-against-speaker-verification.

Often, dozens of analysts scour hundreds of sources to gather, categorize, cluster, and prioritize news items, delivering the most pertinent information to decision makers. However, the sheer volume of sources and news items is continually expanding, making manual searches increasingly challenging. Moreover, the format and presentation of this information vary widely, with each blog entry, threat report, discussion forum, and mailing list item appearing differently, further complicating parsing and extracting relevant data. The research projects NEWSROOM and EUCINF, under the European Defence Fund (EDF), focus on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance mission-oriented cyber situational awareness. These EDF initiatives are instrumental in advancing Taranis AI, a tool designed to categorize news items using machine learning algorithms and extract pertinent entities like company names, products, CVEs, and attacker groups. This enables the indexing and labeling of content, facilitating the identification of relationships and grouping of news items related to the same events - a crucial step in crafting cohesive "stories." These stories enable human analysts to swiftly capture the most significant current "hot topics", alleviating them from the task of consolidating or filtering redundant information from various sources. Taranis AI further enhances its capabilities by automatically generating summaries of reports and stories, and implementing a collaborative ranking system, among other features. This paper serves as an introduction to Taranis AI, exploring its NLP advancements and their practical applications. Additionally, it discusses lessons learned from its implementation and outlines future directions for research and development.

This expansion of IIoT devices will create a wider attack surface and increase the risk of data breaches, privacy violations, and system disruptions. Therefore, it is essential to design innovative mechanisms to ensure the reliability and security of these advanced 6G applications, as well as the IIoT devices that support them. In this context, we propose a novel Software-defined Networking (SDN)-based Ensemble Learning (EL) Framework for Secure IIoT applications in 6G and beyond, called AdaptSDN. The proposed framework leverages SDN technology to dynamically allocate network resources and deploy security measures on demand. It also leverages EL techniques to improve the intrusion detection system's accuracy. By isolating IIoT devices into network slices, the framework limits the impact of attacks and reduces the potential for cascading failures. Digital twins are used for creating a virtual replica of the IIoT network, allowing for a real-time security threat detection. In particular, AdaptSDN includes three main modules: (1) A novel digital Twin (DT)-enabled data gathering and selection of informative features module to achieve two main objectives: reducing computational complexity and improving detection performance; (2) An SDN-based lightweight adaptive boosting module that uses an advanced boosting EL techniques to dynamically adjust weights and to effectively identify and respond to IIoT attacks in real-time; and (3) A zero-touch resources provisioning module that employs a non-cooperative game theory approach. This approach allows for automatically provisioning various resources in a network to efficiently mitigate network attacks; it enables SDN nodes to obtain the required virtual resources, i.e., storage, computing, and bandwidth, from the main orchestrator with respect to IIoT attack type. We carried out comprehensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework in detecting real-world IIoT attacks. The numerical results confirm that AdaptSDN has the potential to enable secure and reliable IIoT applications in 6G and beyond, meeting the stringent service requirements of the new emerging applications.

However, the ease use of social networks for communicating information also makes them particularly vulnerable to social spammers, i.e., ill-intentioned users whose main purpose is to degrade the information quality of social networks through the proliferation of different types of malicious data (e.g., social spam, malware downloads, and phishing) that are collectively called low-quality content. Since Twitter is also rife with low-quality content, several researchers have devised various low-quality detection strategies that inspect tweets for the existence of this kind of content. We carried out a brief literature survey of these low-quality detection strategies, examining which strategies are still applicable in the current scenario - taken into account that Twitter has undergone a lot of changes in the last few years. To gather some evidence of the usefulness of the attributes used by the low-quality detection strategies, we carried out a preliminary evaluation of these attributes.

The amount of malware in mobile phones is increasing exponentially and poses a serious security threat. Google's Android is the most popular smart phone platforms in the world and the mechanisms of permission declaration access control cannot identify the malware. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble machine learning system for the detection of malware on Android devices. More specifically, four groups of features including permissions, monitoring system events, sensitive API and permission rate are extracted to characterize each Android application (app). Then an ensemble random forest classifier is learned to detect whether an app is potentially malicious or not. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on the actual data set using tenfold cross-validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a highly accuracy of 89.91%. For further assessing the performance of our method, we compared it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine classifier. Comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method is extremely promising and could provide a cost-effective alternative for Android malware detection.

These are the systems that inform the relevant unit of all activations that may occur in cases of sudden intervention, from industry to energy and from communication to banking systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition systems store thousands of data on monetary systems. In this article, the prevention of cyberattacks on SCADA systems used in the financial field is discussed. In the introduction part of the article, studies on cyber security are included and the importance of establishing information security policies and putting them into practice is mentioned. In the Materials and Methods section, a simulation of a possible attack on SCADA systems used in the financial field has been created and system vulnerabilities have been identified for this scenario and the results obtained as a result of exploiting the relevant vulnerabilities are given. In the Evaluation and Suggestions section, the results and evaluations of the findings obtained through vulnerability scans and attack analyzes within the scope of the relevant scenario are given and the measures to be taken are included. In addition, in the light of the information obtained in the literature research, what needs to be done to increase the security of SCADA networks has been specified. In the last section, the importance of cyber attacks, depending on the developments in the future, is mentioned by giving the access requirements, necessary times and flow chart for the attacks carried out within the scope of the scenario.

In fact, web usage has become pervasive to touch all aspects of our life, economy and education. These rapid advances have also significantly increase the vulnerabilities of websites that are being hacked on a daily basis. According to White Hat security's "2015 Website Security Statistics Report" more than 86% of all websites have one or more critical vulnerability and the likelihood of information leakage is 56%. With no effective website security measures in place, one can expect the website security to be even more critical. The main research goal of this paper is to overcome this challenge by presenting an online anomaly behavior analysis of websites (e.g., HTML files) to detect any malicious codes or pages that have been injected by web attacks. Our anomaly analysis approach utilizes feature selection, data mining, data analytics and statistical techniques to identify accurately the webpage contents that have been compromised or can be exploited by attacks such as phishing attacks, cross site scripting attacks, html injection attacks, malware insertion attacks, just to name a few. We have validated our approach on more than 10,000 files and showed that our approach can detect malicious HTML files with a true positive rate of 99% and a false positive rate of 0.8% for abnormal files.

Attackers may combine phishing emails, malware, social engineering and botnets to create a series of attacks in one APT attack which makes it quite difficult for detection. In this way, attackers can remotely control the infected host, or steal sensitive information. In this paper, we proposed a time transform features approach for distinguishing APT attacks based on the observation that malicious payload must be transferred to the target hosts in an APT attack. By comparing the normal traffic with the traffic containing a malicious payload, we are able to catch the signal of malicious payload and further infer the existence of APT attacks. Then we use machine learning methods to detect APT attacks in big data. To verify this approach, we placed a device on the gateway of our university for catching the real Internet traffic of the university for one month. Then we mixed the APT traffic with these flows, and see whether our approach can identify the malicious payloads. We found our approach is not only accurate but also efficient for catching APT attacks.

The former has a limited computation ability, whereas the latter has a long detection time. Fog-based attack detection is alternatively used to overcome these problems. However, the current fog-based systems cannot handle the ever-increasing IoMT's big data. Moreover, they are not lightweight and are designed for network attack detection only. In this work, a hybrid (for host and network) lightweight system is proposed for early attack detection in the IoMT fog. In an adaptive online setting, six different incremental classifiers were implemented, namely a novel Weighted Hoeffding Tree Ensemble (WHTE), Incremental K-Nearest Neighbors (IKNN), Incremental Naive Bayes (INB), Hoeffding Tree Majority Class (HTMC), Hoeffding Tree Naive Bayes (HTNB), and Hoeffding Tree Naive Bayes Adaptive (HTNBA). The system was benchmarked with seven heterogeneous sensors and a NetFlow data infected with nine types of recent attack. The results showed that the proposed system worked well on the lightweight fog devices with ~100% accuracy, a low detection time, and a low memory usage of less than 6 MiB. The single-criteria comparative analysis showed that the WHTE ensemble was more accurate and was less sensitive to the concept drift.

However, false data injection attacks based on synchrophasor measurement data pose a serious threat to the safe and reliable operation of modern power systems. To mitigate this problem, a rapid monitoring and defense approach is proposed to defend against cyber attacks. Initially, the Time and Frequency based Convolutional neural Network (TFCN) is proposed to detect different types of attacks. Within the TFCN, the advances are that both time and frequency domain information can be fused without extra spectrum analysis methods, and can save detection time to speed the calculation efficiency using the developed time-frequency block. Next, a comprehensive defense strategy is developed for multiple cyber attacks to ensure the stability and resilience of the power system according to the feedback detection results. The advances of this strategy are that different control strategies can be automatically selected to recover the stability to the greatest extent according to the detected attacks. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the high-speed frequency measurements collected from the wide-area monitoring system are used. The results demonstrate that the cyber attack detection performance can reach 95.57% accuracy, outperforming both traditional and some advanced neural networks. Importantly, the defense strategy is conducted and verified in a modified IEEE 39 bus system as well, which illustrates profound performance in faster stability restoration.

These frameworks comprise of a Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) innovation, conveyed by the driver, and a Smart Key Unit (SKU), mounted in the vehicle with regards to the principal parts of these frameworks. This paper for the first time shows the cyber vulnerability of PEPS in the vehicle against the man-in-the middle attack (MITM). It enables the hacker to open and begin the vehicle, although there was still a distance between the vehicle and the key. To stop this physical cyber attack, we propose a hearty ultra-lightweight common confirmation technique dependent on the radio frequency identification (RFID) convention that cooperates with a decentralized database to verify the PEPS. A secure blockchain based on smart contract is also developed which is compatible with the mutual authentication in the vehicle. A detailed security analysis is performed on an undefined vehicle to prove the high security of the proposed communication approach when facing MITM.

This can further support them continuing to acquire useful cyber-security knowledge, while playing with their peers. Based on this framework, a prototype digital game called "Cyberpoly" was implemented and evaluated. This game allows unfamiliar or potentially unappealing, 'dry' learning contents (on cyber-attacks and incidents) to be placed in a context similar to a "monopoly" game board, encouraging multiple players to take an active role when landing on various cyber-attack or incident squares. The learner can not only answer the questions generated by the game, but also actively send cyber-attacks to other players, when landing on another's land. Learner data was collected from 30 undergraduate participants, with results suggesting that most found it engaging and felt motivated to learn. Further to this, we also obtained feedback from two academic professors, to discuss not only game-play but also game element management.

Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) homograph attack is one of the common threats which deceives web users by fabricating homologous domain names of their accessed websites by exploiting the fact that many characters look alike, for instance, go0gle.com is a homograph targeting to the brand domain google.com by replacing the third character `o' to zero. Since IDN homograph attacks can lead users to web phishing or privacy interception, its detection has been an important challenge. In this paper, we propose an IDN homograph detection method by multi-feature classification based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signalto-noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Compared to the state-of-art existing classification method, our accuracy is increased from 95.07% to 97.04%, and false positive rate (FPR) is reduced from 3.92% to 2.31%.

The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is the most significant security threat addressed in the research. The research proposes edge-heterogeneous IoT (HetIoT) centric defense IDS that aids the HetIoT infrastructure in detecting and blocking victim traffic near the network edge. The Edge-HetIoT defense IDS helps to address significant issues such as performance and security due to proximity to the local network. The research focuses on six learning techniques, including five ma-chine learning (ML) classifiers, namely, ID3, NB, RF, LR, and AdaBoost, and the proposed deep learning (DL)-based hybrid model (i.e., CNN+LSTM). These learning techniques are trained and tested using the real-time benchmark-dataset CICDDoS2019 and consider binary and multiclass (14 classes) classification. The performance is analyzed and evaluated against six classifiers to determine which classification model performs best in detecting and classifying various DDoS attacks. The proposed DL-based hybrid model outperforms when compared against ID3, NB, RF, LR, and AdaBoost. The proposed DL-based hybrid model successfully detects and classifies MSSQL, NetBIOS, TFTP, NTP, Syn, and Portmap attacks with 100% pre-cision, recall, and f1-score. The overall weighted average precision, recall, and f1-score for the proposed DL-based hybrid model are 92%, 89%, and 90%, respectively. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sarkar, A				Sarkar, Arindam			Deep Learning Guided Double Hidden Layer Neural Synchronization Through Mutual Learning	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Neural synchronization; Tree parity machine (TPM ); Session key; Neural network; Mutual learning; Double layer tree parity machine (DLTPM); Generative adversarial network (GAN)	ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; INFORMATION; EXCHANGE; STORAGE; IMAGES	In this paper, a Double Hidden Layer Neural Networks synchronization mechanism using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and mutual learning is used for the development of the cryptographic key exchange protocol. This protocol is used to exchange sensitive information through a public channel. At the time of exchanging sensitive information, an intruder can easily attack the vital information/signals by sniffing, spoofing, phishing, or Man-In-The-Middle attack. There is, however, hardly some investigation to investigate the randomness of the common input vector in the synchronization of two neural networks. This proposed technique provides GAN generated random input vectors for neural synchronization which are very sensitive to the seed value. To enhance the security of the synchronization process, GAN generates the best random sequence of the input vector. Two neural networks use GAN generated input vector and different random weight vector and swap their output. In some steps, it results in complete synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the common learning rule. The synchronized weight vector serves as a session key at the end of the neural synchronization process. An increase in the weight range increases the complexity of a successful attack exponentially but the effort to build the neural key decreases over the polynomial time. The proposed technique offers synchronization and authentication steps in parallel. It is difficult for the attacker to distinguish between synchronization and authentication steps.

As a potential cyber attack, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that block the communication between the rotor speed sensor and the controller of the wind turbine may overload the drive-train and reduce the power generation efficiency. This paper attempts to propose a dual-triggered resilient torque control strategy for the variable-speed wind turbine (VSWT) against DoS attacks. Therein, the mathematical models including the dynamics of the WT and the DoS attack are established, and a neural network observer is designed for the WT system to compensate for the signal losses caused by DoS attack. To guarantee the optimal rotor speed tracking of the WT, an adaptive torque control method based on dual-triggered mechanism is developed, and the attack tolerance capability of the WT system is evaluated. The proposed control strategy can largely enhance the attack resilience capability of the WT, while saving the resources of computation and communication. Extensive studies on a 1.5 MW WT illustrate that the proposed adaptive resilient control scheme can effectively mitigate the impact of the DoS attacks and guarantee the optimal rotor speed tracking performance for the WT system.

J	Li, KH; Ma, WG; Duan, HW; Xie, H; Zhu, JX				Li, Kehong; Ma, Wengang; Duan, Huawei; Xie, Han; Zhu, Juanxiu			Few-shot IoT attack detection based on RFP-CNN and adversarial unsupervised domain-adaptive regularization	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Few-shot IoT attack; Recursive feature pyramid; Neural architecture search; Adversarial unsupervised domain-adaptive regularization; Global clustering center structure regularization	DEEP LEARNING APPROACH; INTRUSION DETECTION; REAL-TIME; INTERNET	The Internet of things (IoT) has attracted extensive research attention in recent years. Cyber-attack protection for IoT devices has become critically important. Malicious users or attackers can take control of IoT devices, thereby putting a wide range of IoT security and privacy data at risk. Thus, the detection and prevention of new attack types are critical in IoT environments. Big data samples are used to train current IoT attack detection models. In certain cases, only few-shot network attack samples can be intercepted. They are susceptible to malicious traffic in an IoT environment, with a reduction in their detection efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose an adversarial unsupervised domain-adaptive regularization and an improved Cascade R-CNN (RFP-CNN) to detect IoT attacks more effectively. First, a feature extraction network (RFP-CNN) is designed. By employing recursive feature pyramids and neural architecture search, the Cascade R-CNN is optimized, and it can extract high-level attack features. Subsequently, an adversarial unsupervised domain-adaptive regularization model is developed, which is known as global cluster center structure regularization. Its purpose is to enable attacks with fewer samples to transfer from other attacks. The model is decoupled into a feature extractor and a domain discriminator using a Siamese network. Finally, our method is validated using four network intrusion datasets pertaining to the IoT. The results demonstrate that our method is capable of extracting time-frequency features. The proposed method exhibits the highest detection accuracy when only a few attack samples are available. It provides excellent anti-noise performance and a short running time when noise is added to the IoT environment. Furthermore, it can be used to detect few-shot IoT attacks in real time.

J	Mohanty, H; Roudsari, AH; Lashkari, AH				Mohanty, Hardhik; Roudsari, Arousha Haghighian; Lashkari, Arash Habibi			Robust stacking ensemble model for darknet traffic classification under adversarial settings	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Darknet traffic classification; Adversarial attacks; Defense mechanism; Autoencoder based defence; Robustness analysis	FEATURE-SELECTION; MACHINE; ATTACKS	Encrypted traffic tunnelled by Tor or VPN is referred to as darknet traffic. The ability to detect, identify, and characterize darknet traffic is critical for detecting network traffic generated by a cyber-attack. Darknet classification models based on Machine Learning / Deep Learning (ML/DL) usually demonstrate high False Positive Rate (FPR) and lower Fl-score which are essential metrics for network traffic analysis. Additionally, ML/DL models used in such tasks are susceptible to adversarial perturbed samples that can cause the network security solution to malfunction. This work proposes a Stacking Ensemble (SE) model to combine the predictions of three base learners, 1) Random Forest, 2) K-Nearest Neighbors, and 3) Decision Tree in the most efficient way for improving the overall performance of darknet characterization. A two-layered autoencoder-based defence mechanism consisting of a detector and denoiser is devised to increase the robustness of the network security system against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through extensive experiments using the CIC-Darknet-2020 dataset. The robustness of the model is tested against three highly transferable adversarial attacks, 1) Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), 2) Basic Iterative Method (BIM), 3) DeepFool and a realistic 4) Boundary attack. The experimental results show that the SE model outperforms the baseline Deep Image and other competitor models by achieving an accuracy score of 98.89% and an FPR of 0.43% in the case of darknet traffic identification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 97.88% is achieved in the case of darknet traffic flow characterization. In addition, the statistical properties of the packet flow are identified as the most commonly affected features by adversarial attacks through the Mean Adversarial Perturbation (MAP) metric.

Unfortunately, FL is vulnerable to an up-to-date security threat, model poisoning attacks. By successfully replacing the global model with the targeted poisoned model, malicious end devices can trigger backdoor attacks and manipulate the whole learning process. The traditional researches under a homogeneous environment can ideally exclude the outliers with scarce side-effects on model performance. However, in privacy-preserving FL, each end device possibly owns a few data classes and different amounts of data, forming into a substantial heterogeneous environment where outliers could be malicious or benign. To achieve the system performance and robustness of FL's framework, we should not assertively remove any local model from the global model updating procedure. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a defending strategy called FedEqual to mitigate model poisoning attacks while preserving the learning task's performance without excluding any benign models.

In recent years, lack of awareness regarding technological advancements has paved the way for an intense increase in various types of aggressive cyber-attacks such as phishing, scamming, hacking etc. Under-reporting of cybercrimes serves as a major impediment in efficient and timely handling of cybercrimes, and hence can cause serious consequences. Manually staying informed regarding emerging cybersecurity threats is a time taking and laborious task, creating the need of developing robust systems that could efficiently report news related to cybercrimes. This requires development of information retrieval models to extract cybersecurity news belonging to different categories from various online resources. The focus of this research is to propose a model for detection of cyber offences reported on news articles and blogs. Further in order to analyze the authenticity of news obtained via news articles/blogs, a novel source verification model is proposed by investigating various authenticity parameters and assigning weightages to these parameters.

These attacks are robust (i.e., physically-realizable) and universally malicious, and hence represent a severe security threat to real-world DNN-based systems. We propose Jujutsu, a two-stage technique to detect and mitigate robust and universal adversarial patch attacks. We first observe that adversarial patches are crafted as localized features that yield large influence on the prediction output, and continue to dominate the prediction on any input. Jujutsu leverages this observation for accurate attack detection with low false positives. Patch attacks corrupt only a localized region of the input, while the majority of the input remains unperturbed. Therefore, Jujutsu leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform localized attack recovery by synthesizing the semantic contents of the input that are corrupted by the attacks, and reconstructs a "clean" input for correct prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on four diverse datasets spanning 8 different DNN models, and find that it achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms four existing defenses. We further evaluate Jujutsu against physical-world attacks, as well as adaptive attacks.

Because of its function combined with the exponential growth of the internet, it has become an essential component. Because of this, attackers use DNS for malicious activities, such as Phishing, Fast-Flux Domains, DGAs, in addition to the spread of malware. In this paper we present an approach for automatic detection of malicious domains using a Passive DNS dataset combined with machine learning techniques. One way to perform the detection of these malicious domains is by blocklists, which can take some time before someone reports and there is human analysis. The model presented in this work is capable of detecting malicious domains at an early stage through its Passive DNS traffic. 12 features were extracted exclusively from DNS traffic. Our model makes use of the XGBoost supervised machine learning algorithm, and obtains an average AUC of 0.976.

In this paper, we emulate the effects of natural weather conditions to introduce plausible perturbations that mislead the DNNs. By observing the effects of such atmospheric perturbations on the camera lenses, we model the patterns to create different masks that fake the effects of rain, snow, and hail. Even though the perturbations introduced by our attacks are visible, their presence remains unnoticed due to their association with natural events, which can be especially catastrophic for fully-autonomous and unmanned vehicles. We test our proposed fakeWeather attacks on multiple Convolutional Neural Network and Capsule Network models, and report noticeable accuracy drops in the presence of such adversarial perturbations. Our work introduces a new security threat for DNNs, which is especially severe for safety-critical applications and autonomous systems.

Researchers have found that many new types of malicious code are variants of the existing one. The homology classification of the unknown malicious code can find its corresponding family in which all the code share inherent similarities from the database, so that the defenders can make rapid response and processing. We use the algorithm of malicious code visualization to translate the homology classification problem into the image classification problem. A convolution neural network for malicious code image is constructed. We train it to complete the malicious code homology classification on two different datasets. The results show that our work outperforms most of existing work with the accuracy of 98.60%.

On the other hand, the trend of cyberattacks is on the rise in today's modern Web-driven world. Therefore, effective countermeasures for the analysis and detection of malicious websites is crucial to combat the rising threats to the cyber world security. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques and identified a total of about 230 features of malicious websites, which are classified as internal and external features. Moreover, we developed a toolkit for the analysis and modeling of malicious websites. The toolkit has implemented several types of feature extraction methods and machine learning algorithms, which can be used to analyze and compare different approaches to detect malicious URLs. Moreover, the toolkit incorporates several other options such as feature selection and imbalanced learning with flexibility to be extended to include more functionality and generalization capabilities. Moreover, some use cases are demonstrated for different datasets.

It is an understudied threat that gains traction with the popularity of smartspeakers and the resurgence of content consumption exclusively via audio, such as podcasts. Defending against sound-squatting is complex, and existing solutions rely on manually curated lists of homophones, which limits the search to a few (and mostly existing) words only. We introduce Sound-squatter, a multi-language AI-based system that generates sound-squatting candidates for proactive defense that covers over 80% of exact homophones and further generating thousands of high-quality approximated homophones. Sound-squatter relies on a state-of-art Transformer Network to learn transliteration. We search for Sound-squatter generated cross-language sound-squatting domains over hundreds of millions of emitted TLS certificates comparing with other types of squatting candidates. Our finding reveals that around 6% of generated sound-squatting candidates have emitted TLS certificates, compared to 8% of other types of squatting candidates. We believe Sound-squatter uncovers the usage of multilingual sound-squatting phenomenon on the Internet and it is a crucial asset for proactive protection against sound-squatting.

Most cybercrimes are launched through malware attacks, phishing attacks, denial/distributed denial of attacks, looting people's money, stealing credential information for unauthorized use, personal identity thefts, etc. Timely detection of malware can avoid such damage. However, it requires an efficient and effective approach to detecting such attacks. This study attempts to devise a malware detection approach using transfer learning and machine learning algorithms. A hybrid approach has been adopted where pre-trained models VVG-16 and ResNet-50 extract hybrid feature sets from the data to be used with the machine learning algorithms. In doing so, this study contrives the Bi-model architecture where the same models are combined sequentially in the stacked form to obtain higher performance as the output of the first model is used to train the second model. With the Bi-model structure, 100% accuracy is obtained for a 25 classes problem.

In this situation, it's critical to design and construct software that is both secure and long-lasting. While security is the most well-defined aspect of health information software systems, it is equally significant to prioritise sustainability because any health information software system will be more effective if it provides both security and sustainability to the customers at the same time. In this league, it is crucial to determine those characteristics in the systems that can help in the accurate assessment of the sustainable-security of the health information software during the development stage. This research work employed the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (Fuzzy ANP) to estimate the impact of the overall sustainable-security of health information software systems and their characteristics in order to achieve a high level of sustainable-security. Furthermore, the study validates the efficacy of the Fuzzy ANP procedure by testing it on five different versions of a health information software system through Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (Fuzzy TOPSIS). Despite the sensitivity of the health information software systems, this study employedmultiple versions of health information software system. When compared with the existing procedures for testing the sustainable-security of health information software systems, the outcomes were conclusive and significantly more effective. Besides saving time and resources, the mechanism suggested in this research work aims to establish an outline that software practitioners can follow to enhance the sustainable-security of health information software systems.

J	Nerini, M; Favarelli, E; Chiani, M				Nerini, Matteo; Favarelli, Elia; Chiani, Marco			Augmented PIN Authentication through Behavioral Biometrics	SENSORS			English	Article						behavioral biometrics; motion sensors; Machine Learning; cyber security; Personal Identification Number	SUPPORT	Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are widely used today for user authentication on mobile devices. However, this authentication method can be subject to several attacks such as phishing, smudge, and side-channel. In this paper, we increase the security of PIN-based authentication by considering behavioral biometrics, specifically the smartphone movements typical of each user. To this end, we propose a method based on anomaly detection that is capable of recognizing whether the PIN is inserted by the smartphone owner or by an attacker. This decision is taken according to the smartphone movements, which are recorded during the PIN insertion through the built-in motion sensors. For each digit in the PIN, an anomaly score is computed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Subsequently, these scores are combined to obtain the final decision metric. Numerical results show that our authentication method can achieve an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 5% in the case of 4-digit PINs, and 4% in the case of 6-digit PINs. Considering a reduced training set, composed of solely 50 samples, the EER only slightly worsens, reaching 6%. The practicality of our approach is further confirmed by the low processing time required, on the order of fractions of milliseconds.

C	Merz, TR; Rosado, RM		Wilson RL; Curran MB		Merz, Terry R.; Rosado, Romarie Morales			Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Assessing the Consequences of Cyber Mitigation Techniques on Industrial Control Systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY ICCWS			English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ICCWS)	MAR 09-10, 2023	Towson Univ, Baltimore, MD		Towson Univ	Deep reinforcement learning; APT; ICS; Mitigation; AI based automated attacks; ICS cyber-attacks; energy security; cybersecurity		This paper discusses an in-progress study involving the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to mitigate the effects of an advanced cyber-attack against industrial control systems (ICS). The research is a qualitative, exploratory study which emerged as a gap during the execution of two rapid prototyping studies. During these studies, cyber defensive procedures, known as "Mitigation, were characterized as actions taken to minimize the impact of ongoing advanced cyber-attacks against an ICS while enabling primary operations to continue. To execute Mitigation procedures, affected ICS components required rapid isolation and quarantining from "healthy" system segments. However today, with most attacks leveraging automation, mitigation also requires rapid decision-making capabilities operating at the speed of automation yet with human-like refinement. The authors settled on the choice of DRL as a viable solution to this problem due to the algorithm's designs which involves "intelligent" decisions based upon continuous learning achieved through a rewards system. The primary theory of this study posits that processes informed by data sources relative to the execution path of an advanced cyber-attack as well as the consequences of deploying a particular Mitigation procedure evolve the system into an ever-improving defensive capability. This study seeks to produce a defensive DLR based software agent trained by a DRL based offensive software agent that generates policy refinements based upon extrapolations from a corrupted network state as reported by an IDS and baseline data. Results include an estimation rule that would quantify impacts of various mitigation actions while protecting the operational critical path and isolating an in-progress attack. This study is in a conceptual phase and development has not started. This research questions for this study are: RQ1: Can this software agent categorize correctly an in-progress cyber-attack and extrapolate the potential ICS assets affected? RQ2: Can this software agent categorize novel cyber-attacks and extrapolate a probable attack vector while enumerating affected assets? RQ3: Can this software agent characterize how operations are affected by quarantine actions? RQ4: Can this software agent generate a set of ranked recommended courses of action by effectiveness, and least negative effects on the operational critical path?

Additionally, it becomes especially challenging to detect attacks timely as they become more sophisticated and multifaceted. To address this issue, we propose a stacking ensemble network detection model based on industrial processes in water treatment systems, where the attacks are identified through recognizing anomalies caused by the underlying dynamics of the industrial control system. In the proposed detection model, we utilize a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to facilitate multi-module training, taking into consideration the multi-stage process of the water conservancy system.Furthermore, we adopt Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to effectively integrate the predicted results. To optimize the performance of this model, we leverage a Population Based Training (PBT) of Neural Networks to finetune the parameters. For each sensor parameter, the residuals between the predicted and measured data are classified using a sliding window-based dynamic threshold to identify anomalies. Based on the Real Safe Water Treatment (SWaT) system dataset,we evaluate the accuracy of our proposed scheme with three other schemes. The experimental comparison results show that the accuracy of our scheme is better than those of all the other three schemes.

Proposed system consists of signature-based NIDPS, honeypot and temporary queue. When proposed system receives packet from external network, packet which is known for attack packet is dropped by signature-based NIDPS. Passed packets are redirected to honeypot, because proposed system assumes that all packets which pass NIDPS have possibility of zero-day attack. Redirected packet is stored in temporary queue and if the packet has possibility of zero-day attack, honeypot extracts signature of the packet. Proposed system creates rule that match rule format of NIDPS based on extracted signatures and updates the rule. After the rule update is completed, temporary queue sends stored packet to NIDPS then packet with risk of attack can be dropped. Proposed system can reduce time to create and apply rule which can respond to unknown attack packets. Also, it can drop packets that have risk of zero-day attack in real time.

J	Salehpour, A; Al-Anbagi, I				Salehpour, Ali; Al-Anbagi, Irfan			Digital Substations: Cyberattack detection system for small modular reactor-based power plants.	IEEE ELECTRIFICATION MAGAZINE			English	Article						Waste management; Renewable energy sources; Supply chains; Real-time systems; Nuclear power generation; Industrial safety; Smart grids; Magnetosphere; Cyberattack; Testing; Inductors; Digital systems; Substations; Power system planning; Modular construction		Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), with capacities under 300 MWe, are proposed as potential solutions to various challenges in nuclear power, such as economic viability, safety, proliferation risks, and waste management. Their compact size makes them ideal for areas with limited grid capacity and allows for flexible energy generation and integration with renewable sources, which is increasingly essential for developing economies. However, the cyber security of SMRs is vital due to their importance in national infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities within their supply chains, which could lead to serious safety and operational disruptions from cyber-attacks. The risk is compounded by blended attack strategies, where physical and cyber assaults are executed simultaneously, highlighting the need for robust cyber security measures as outlined by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Design of Cyber Security for Critical Infrastructures: A Case for a Schizoid Design Approach	SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY ENGINEERING (SPACE 2015)	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Security, Privacy, and Applied Cryptography Engineering (SPACE)	OCT 03-07, 2015	Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Jaipur, INDIA		Malaviya Natl Inst Technol			In this invited talk, we argue that designing cyber security of critical infrastructure requires a spilt-personality approach to design as opposed to design for correctness or for performance. Designing a functionally correct system, or a performance constrained system is fundamentally different in the sense that such design requires us to build models and to systematically refine models towards implementation such that correctness is preserved between refinements, and performance optimizations are introduced during refinements. Designing systems with cyber-security properties requires us to not only build models from theoretical principles, but also require modeling possible behaviors of an adversary. Modeling adversarial behavior is akin to test-driven model refinement, and hence not so different from certain approaches used when our goal is functionally correct design. However, for cyber-physical systems, we often need to detect an ongoing cyber attack since safe guards for cyber security often depend on assumptions which can be invalidated (e. g., insider attacks may invalidate perimeter security assumptions). Detecting ongoing attacks requires detecting behavioral anomalies in the physical system under cyber control - thus requiring us to build models from data. Machine learning approaches could be used to build such models. This we view as a schizoid approach - since the designer has to not only model the system from physical principles, he/she also has to build nominal behavioral models from data. While arguing this point of view, we introduce a virtual SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) laboratory we have built to help design cyber security of critical systems. The majority of this talk focuses on describing this software based virtual laboratory called VSCADA. Most of this research is published in [8,11] and summarized here for the sake of exposition to the present audience.

J	Srivastava, A; Sinha, D; Kumar, V				Srivastava, Arpita; Sinha, Ditipriya; Kumar, Vikash			WCGAN-GP based synthetic attack data generation with GA based feature selection for IDS	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Intrusion detection system; Cyber-attacks; Wasserstein generative adversarial network; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFIER	Cyber-attack is one of the alarming issues in today's era. Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and other techniques are popularly applied to prevent those attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) works as the watchdog to monitor the network traffic and identify an alert when an unauthorized action is detected. However, most IDSs are designed on traditional datasets, which do not address the data imbalance problem. As a result, their performance is not good enough against minority class samples. In order to overcome the aforementioned problem and detect cyber-attacks with higher precision, this paper proposes a novel IDS applying Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network - Gradient Penalty (WCGAN-GP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The objective of the two components- WCGAN-GP and Genetic Algorithm are introduced in the proposed work for synthetic data generation, feature optimization, and attack detection system. The proposed model generates synthetic samples that follow the underlying data distribution of actual data. This paper uses a novel fitness function for the convergence of the Genetic algorithm and produces an optimal feature vector for the classification problem. In this work, an extensive experimental study applying NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets in combination with generated samples and reduced feature set from the proposed model is carried out to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models. Observations show that Xgboost gives the best performances among others. To justify using a genetic algorithm for feature optimization, this paper has compared the proposed model with other traditional feature selection approaches such as PCA, Autoencoder, and T-SNE on the proposed model. It is found that the proposed GA-based feature selection outperforms others. The reason behind it is that the GA-based feature selection technique offers certain advantages over PCA and Autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction techniques, such as the ability to handle non-linearity between features in the data, enhanced flexibility in feature selection, interpretability, and human insight, handling high-dimensional data, robustness to noise and outliers. It also offers an advantage over T-SNE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique in terms of computational efficiency. Furthermore, the model is also compared with other state-of-theart which address data imbalance problems. Our proposed model with Xgboost classifier gives better results than other existing approaches in terms of accuracy (95.54%), precision (92.61%), recall (95.54%), F1-score (93.41%), and false alarm rate (4.30%) on the NSL-KDD dataset and accuracy (89.58%), precision (89.46%), recall (89.58%), F1-score (88.89%) and false alarm rate (1.18%) on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

In this paper we demonstrate that this premise is erroneous by assessing the strengths and limitations of prominent robustness methods in light of facial authentication, a realistic use case where adversarial perturbations pose a real threat, which allows for a natural reflection on the security gained by the obtained robustness. The main contribution of this paper is an evaluation and critical reflection upon why prominent robustness methods fail to deliver a secure system despite living up to their promises of adding robustness. Our analysis shows that stateof-the-art robustness methods such as Adversarial Training and Guided Complement Entropy struggle to accommodate for two key requirements of facial authentication: (1) the threat model of facial authentication assumes physical adversarial examples that can be added to the scene as opposed to "classical" adversarial examples that are applied to the digital input. Moreover, an attacker that can directly perturb digital input, does not require adversarial perturbations to impersonate their victim; (2) robustness properties are only validated for standard classification problems, and often ignore the impact of more practical training paradigms that re-purpose models. Our extensive evaluation of robustness in light of facial authentication allowed us to pinpoint the limitations of these methods. To ensure that the concepts of adversarial robustness and security are more tightly coupled, we recommend to evaluate new defences with applications where adversarial perturbations pose a security threat.

This leads to concerns due to their potential exploitation in Botnet attacks. Botnet attack itself uses contaminated IoT devices to launch cyber-attacks. Deep learning is commonly used in cyber-attack detection, especially in botnet attack detection. However, some deep learning models still do not detect a class that has a small amount of data in the dataset (imbalanced dataset), This causes the model accuracy to be less effective in certain classes. To address the problem we introduced the Fed-Bi-GRU and Cen-Bi-GRU models to detect botnet attacks. In this study to evaluate and analyze our models we used the BoT-IoT dataset. We calculated the precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy of each model. The goal of this paper was to recognize the most effective model for detecting botnet attacks and prove that the federated learning approach could be used to produce a robust model that competes effectively with centralized learning. In this paper, our models successfully got a good performance in detecting the theft class, we got 100% in precision, recall, and f1-score. Where the theft data had the smallest amount of data in the BoT-IoT dataset. Moreover, our model got 99.98% accuracy for Cen-Bi-GRU and 99.97% for Fed-Bi-GRU. Both models successfully got high score of accuracy. It means our model is efficient to be used for botnet attack detection especially it can adapt to imbalanced data.	[Maharddhika, I.

Autonomous decision making and smart manufacturing are flourishing in the current age of Industry 4.0. By providing more compute power to edge devices and connecting them to the internet, the so-called Cyber Physical Systems are prone to security threats like never before. Security in the current industry is based on cryptographic techniques that use pseudo-random number keys. Keys generated by a pseudo-random number generator pose a security threat as they can be predicted by a malicious third party. In this work, we propose a secure Industrial IoT Architecture that makes use of true random numbers generated by a quantum random number generator (QRNG). CITRIOT's FireConnect IoT node is used to show the proof of concept in a quantum-safe network where the random keys are generated by a cloud based quantum device. We provide an implementation of QRNG on both real quantum computer and quantum simulator. Then, we compare the results with pseudo-random numbers generated by a classical computer.

J	Sarkar, A				Sarkar, Arindam			Faster Synchronization of Triple Layer Neural Network Using Nature Inspired Whale Optimization: A Key Exchange Protocol	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Neural synchronization; Session key; Artificial neural network (ANN); Mutual learning; Whale optimization; Triple layer tree parity machine (TLTPM)		The secret key swap over protocol is developed using a Whale Optimization-guided Three Layer Neural Networks coordination mechanism in this article. An adversary can target crucial data while transferring confidential information via sniff, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), phishing, or spoofing assault. Sensitive material must be delivered securely while adhering to the security hardening requirements of authentication, secrecy, and integrity. These criteria need the use of a secure protocol that is both end-to-end and resilient. For quicker coordination, this suggested technique uses a whale-guided optimization on the weights of the Triple Layer Tree Parity Machine (TLTPM). Because the optimum contributes to computational efficiency, a larger weight range might be considered to improve TLTPM safety. The difficulty of an effective assault grows exponentially as the weight spectrum is increased, whereas the efforts required to create the neural key reduces over polynomially. As a result, guessing the inner structure will be challenging for the adversary. The session key is the coordinated weight matrix. The suggested method allows for simultaneous coordination and verification. The adversary has a hard time distinguishing amongst coordination and verification stages. Various parameter tests have been run on the suggested method. The collected findings are evaluated, resulting in improved adjustments. The outcomes have proven to be efficient and sustainable. In respect of the reported outcomes in the study, evaluations of the procedure demonstrate efficacy.

Because many people use computers, smartphones, and e-mail to perform day-to-day tasks, various data traffic is susceptible to attack. This can undermine the competitiveness of a company that may have breached strategic information. Therefore, security and information management are fundamental factors for companies to keep due control and management of their business knowledge. Cyber attacks are represented by a growing worldwide scale of secrecy breach of relevant information and are characterized as one of the significant challenges of the contemporary world. This article aims to propose a computational system based on intelligent hybrid models, which through fuzzy rules allows the construction of expert systems in attacks on cybernetic data of diverse natures. The tests were carried out with real bases of attacks on the database of governmental computerized devices. The model proposed in this paper uses fuzzy evolving data grouping concepts. The extreme learning machine performs the training and the logical neurons of the unineuron type are responsible for creating fuzzy rules capable of transforming the knowledge acquired by the model into a database for employee training in companies, construction of other computer systems and awareness of elements which may harm the integrity of the data of individuals and companies. The novelty of the intelligent technique presented in the paper is that the nature of cyber attacks defines the structure of the model because the techniques of fuzzification and regularization are based entirely on the complexity of the cybernetic invasions. The binary pattern classification tests confronted with traditional models of the literature prove that the proposal of this paper can maintain the accuracy of detection of cyber attacks and still manages to construct a set of rules that serve as knowledge for the companies that wish to protect their information from attacks devices.

J	Di, L; Lv, Z; Chang, H; Cai, JF				Di, Li; Lv, Zhuo; Chang, Hao; Cai, Junfei			Distributed Photovoltaic Communication Anomaly Detection Based on Spatiotemporal Feature Collaborative Modeling	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						photovoltaic microgrid; deep learning; cyberattack detection; attention mechanism	CYBER-ATTACK DETECTION; SUPPORT; FARMS; PV	As distributed photovoltaic (PV) technology rapidly develops and is widely applied, the methods of cyberattacks are continuously evolving, posing increasingly severe threats to the communication networks of distributed PV systems. Recent studies have shown that the Transformer model, which effectively integrates global information and handles long-distance dependencies, has garnered significant attention. Based on this, our research proposes a model named STformer, which is applied to the task of attack detection in distributed PV communication. Specifically, we propose a temporal attention mechanism and a variable attention mechanism. The temporal attention mechanism focuses on capturing subtle changes and trends in data sequences over time, ensuring a highly sensitive recognition of patterns inherent in time-series data. In contrast, the variable attention mechanism analyzes the intrinsic relationships and interactions between different variables, uncovering critical correlations that may indicate abnormal behavior or potential attacks. Additionally, we incorporate the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction technique. This technique not only helps reduce computational complexity but, in certain cases, can enhance anomaly detection performance. Finally, compared to classical and advanced methods, STformer demonstrates satisfactory performance in simulation experiments.

Also, hackers can make use of these servers to threaten public network security, such as DDoS and Phishing attacks. Hence, the study of identifying these servers is pretty crucial. Current works on detecting Shadowsocks servers are mostly based on the features of servers' data stream combined with machine learning. However, they are passive methods because they can only be established when the servers are in connection state. Therefore, we propose a new system named ACER, which AC means active and ER means expert, to detect these servers. Besides, we introduce XGBoost algorithm to process the data stream to optimize the detection. The method can recognize more Shadowsocks servers actively instead of monitoring the communication tunnel passively to identify the servers. The experiment result has achieved an accuracy of 94.63% by taking proposed framework and 1.20% more accurate than other existing solutions. We hope to provide a novel solution for those who are conducting research in this area, and provide a detection scheme for network censors to block illegal servers at the same time.

The potential of integrating blockchain technology into smart sustainable city development	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY 2019	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Green Technology (SEGT)	DEC 11-14, 2019	Bangkok, THAILAND					The rise of global urbanisation has led to massive pressures on resources such as food, water, infrastructure, and energy demand to support growing populations. It brings adverse impacts on the liveable condition and economic growth of a country if this problem remains unsolved. Smart city is a potential solution to address the challenges of urbanisation by leveraging the technological breakthrough such as internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data, and cloud computing to facilitate scarce resources planning and management. With numerous connected devices and vast communication networks, it poses a challenges of security threat which cannot be addressed by the conventional cybersecurity solutions. Blockchain offers a solution in securing the huge numbers of connected devices in smart city network. The application of blockchain technology is leading in the banking and financial industry. However, the uses and implementations in smart city have emerged in recent years. The combination of blockchain technology and smart city has offered a great potential for sustainable development. Thus, it is imperative to discuss the potential of these two elements in making the city safer and sustainable. This paper explores how the blockchain technology application can help in managing smart city and achieve sustainability. The findings revealed that there are five key areas of blockchain application in smart city which are smart governance, smart mobility, smart asset, smart utility and smart logistic. A framework for smart sustainable city with blockchain technology is presented as an outcome of this study. It gives a clear overview for the policy makers and regulators of how blockchain supports within smart city framework. It facilitates the transition towards smart and sustainable cities through the use of blockchain.	[Wong, P. F.; Chia, F. C.; Kiu, M.

This paper proposes a data-driven cyberattack detection strategy for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Ideas of long short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) as the core of detection achieve time series classification to diagnose the target and mode of cyberattack. Input de-redundancy and hyperparameter selection are conducted to optimize the detection. Meanwhile, well-designed cyberattack toolboxes of false data injection (FDI), denial-of-service (DoS) and delay are applied upon the communication of both sampled signals and issued commands in a grid-connected inverter model. By observing system performance via electrical measurements, this case study evaluates the LSTM, CNN-LSTM and convolutional LSTM based detection and obtains stable high quality of classification.

Despite this, attackers use encrypted web pages to hide real web content, such as phishing pages, malware, bots, etc. Detecting such vulnerable web pages and malicious phishing websites can be accomplished by identifying encrypted web pages. In recent years, using traffic features and machine learning to identify encrypted web pages is one of the most important research directions in cyber security. In this paper, we propose ENiD, an encrypted web page traffic identification approach. This method uses upload-only blocks and accumulation response size to describe the web page visiting process. Based on a large number of encrypted web page traffic case studies, we evaluated the contributions of different features and selected those features that contributed the most. We first capture and publish the encrypted web pages traffic dataset, which contains 8,480 web pages traffic. We evaluate our method's effectiveness by four machine learning algorithms, which shows that our approach achieved accuracy and an F1 score of 0.97 on 50 web pages. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of ENiD on different numbers of web pages, and the results demonstrate that our methods are still effective on more than 400 web pages.

On the Ethereum platform, Ponzi schemes, phishing scams, and a variety of other frauds emerge. Existing Ponzi scheme detection approaches based on heterogeneous transaction graph modeling leverages semantic information between node (account) pairs to establish connections, overlooking the semantic attributes inherent to the edges (interactions). To overcome this, we construct heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs with multiple triplet interaction patterns to better depict the real Ethereum environment. Based on this, we design a new framework named multi-triplet augmented heterogeneous graph neural network (MAHGNN) for Ponzi scheme detection. We introduce the Conditional Variational Auto Encoder (CVAE) to capture the semantic information of different triplet interaction patterns, which facilitates the characterization on account features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAHGNN is capable of addressing the problem of multi-edge interactions in heterogeneous Ethereum interaction graphs and achieving stateof-the-art performance in Ponzi scheme detection.

The interaction between digital healthcare and MANET presents several challenges. Providing security to such networks is challenging. This paper will investigate how collaborative attacks constitute a security threat. The collaborative attacks that will be investigated are gray hole and wormhole attacks. In addition, the investigation will cover the categories of collaborative attacks. Experiments were simulated for the different categories of the collaborative wormhole and gray hole attacks. To understand the severity of the attacks, experiments were conducted using ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol under various ad-hoc network conditions such as: packet delivery; routing overhead and end-to-end delay routing. The network conditions were analyzed at each node level, using their node identity (ID) to indicate the presence of an attack within a network, and finally, some suggestions were made about what might be done to defend against the attack	[Fasunlade, Olufemi; Zhou, Shikun; Sanders, David] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Portsmouth, Hants, England	University of Portsmouth	Fasunlade, O (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Portsmouth, Hants, England.	oluwafemi.fasunlade@port.ac.uk; shikun.zhou@port.ac.uk; david.sanders@port.ac.uk	; Sanders, David/B-7549-2008	Zhou, Shikun/0000-0003-2136-4826; Sanders, David/0000-0002-4359-6743	EPSRC [EP/S005927/1] Funding Source: UKRI	EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))		[Anonymous], 2012, P INT C SYSTEM ENG T; [Anonymous], 2016, IEEE INT C COMP COMM; Chang JM, 2015, IEEE SYST J, V9, P65, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2013.2296197; Chelvan P.M., 2016, 2016 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC), P1, DOI [10.1109/ICCIC.2016.7919544, DOI 10.1109/ICCIC.2016.7919544]; Emami AB, 2015, CAN CON EL COMP EN, P903, DOI 10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395; Fasunlade O, 2020, P INT COMP SOFTW APP, P1542, DOI 10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.00-36; Ibrahim HM, 2015, INT J ADV COMPUT SC, V6, P60; Kapur RK, 2015, 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS (ICACEA), P791, DOI 10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164811; Karthigha M, 2020, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE COMPUTATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICICT-2020), P396, DOI [10.1109/ICICT48043.2020.9112588, 10.1109/icict48043.2020.9112588]; Kaur T, 2018, IEEE INT C SM E GR E, P288, DOI 10.1109/SEGE.2018.8499473; Khan FA, 2017, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V68, P416, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2016.07.010; Khandare P, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE SYSTEMS AND CONTROL (ICISC 2017), P777; Kumar R., 2015, REMOTE PATIENT MONIT, P4275; Mehta S., 2013, ANAL BLACK HOLE WORM, V1, P44; Ndzi DL, 2014, COMPUT ELECTRON AGR, V105, P83, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2014.04.012; Ozturk C, 2018, P EUR C COMP VIS ECC; Patidar K., 2014, PROC 2014 C IT BUSIN; Prashar L, 2016, INT CONF RELI INFO, P405, DOI 10.1109/ICRITO.2016.7784989; Rana A, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V70, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.10.060; Sanders DA, 2019, ADV INTELL SYST, V869, P1229, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-01057-7_92; Shbib Reda, 2013, Pervasive Computing and the Networked World.

In this work, an approach capable of detecting malicious domains just 72 hours after the first DNS query was developed. The data source used was the passive DNS collected from an authoritative TLD server with the enrichment of data later, which generated columns encompassing data related to geolocation, which resulted in 20 features. The model used Light-GBM as a machine learning algorithm, and oversampling and undersampling techniques for data balancing, such as Cluster Centroids and K-Means SMOTE, proving efficiency with an average AUC of 0.9763 and F1-score of 0.905, in addition to the TPR of 0.8656 in the validation of the model.

J	Naeem, H; Ullah, F; Srivastava, G				Naeem, Hamad; Ullah, Farhan; Srivastava, Gautam			Classification of intrusion cyber-attacks in smart power grids using deep ensemble learning with metaheuristic-based optimization	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						cyber-attack; ensemble learning; explainable artificial intelligence; Grey-Wolf optimizer; intrusion classification; smart cities; smart grids	FEATURE-SELECTION; SYSTEMS; CNN	The most advanced power grid design, known as a 'smart power grid', integrates information and communication technology (ICT) with a conventional grid system to enable remote management of electricity distribution. The intelligent cyber-physical architecture enables bidirectional, real-time data sharing between electricity suppliers and consumers through smart meters and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Data protection issues, such as data tampering, firmware exploitation, and the leakage of sensitive information arise due to the smart power grid's substantial reliance on ICT. To maintain reliable and efficient power distribution, these issues must be identified and resolved quickly. Intrusion detection is essential for providing secure services and alerting system administrators in the case of adversary attacks. This paper proposes an intrusion classification scheme that identifies several types of cyber attacks on modern smart power grids. Grey-Wolf metaheuristic optimization-based feature selection is used to learn non-linear, overlapping, and complex electrical grid properties. An extended deep-stacked ensemble technique is advanced by putting predictions from weak learners (CNNs) into a meta-learner (MLP). The outcomes of this approach are explained and confirmed using explainable AI (XAI). The publicly available dataset from Mississippi State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (MSU-ORNL) is used to conduct experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a peak accuracy of 96.6% while scrutinizing the original MSU-ORNL data feature set and a maximum accuracy of 99% when analysing the selected feature set.

These attacks have become a major threat to the security of computer networks and systems, and effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for detecting and mitigating these attacks. IDSs are used to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and can help detect and prevent DDoS attacks. Most IDSs are often designed to identify diverse types of attacks, but their efficacy can be limited when faced with attacks that exhibit extensive variations and sophisticated techniques, such as DDoS. In order to establish an effective IDS capable of identifying DDoS attacks, the acquisition of substantial volumes of labelled network data becomes crucial. This study aims to evaluate the performance of recent generative models in synthesising realistic tabular data to accurately emulate DDoS attack patterns. To achieve this, we used the CIC-DDOS2019 dataset, a comprehensive and modern collection of real-world DDoS attack scenarios. Leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, namely CTGAN, TVAE, and CopulaGAN, we synthesised realistic tabular data that emulated the characteristics and patterns observed in DDoS attack flow. We utilised various statistical metrics such as correlation scores, similarity and distance metrics, along with machine learning performance metrics, to quantitatively measure the performance of the generative models. The findings indicate that all three models have the ability to accurately emulate the patterns found in the real database, resulting in the generation of useful synthetic data. Specifically, among the classification methods used, the Random Forest method showed the most successful performance in detecting attacks with an accuracy of 99% when applied to the original dataset. In comparison, it achieved accuracy levels of 98%, 99%, and 93% when applied to datasets generated using the CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TVAE models respectively. It can be concluded that generative networks have the potential to be useful in synthesising tabular data and may contribute to the overall performance of existing and future IDS. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that to cover a wider spectrum of attacks, more specific adjustments may need to be applied both in the data preprocessing stage and in the model architectures.

LLMs bolster defense against cyber threats but also introduce risks, aiding adversaries in generating malicious content, discovering vulnerabilities, and distorting perceptions. This paper presents Net-GPT, an LLMempowered offensive chatbot that understands network protocols and launches Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based Man-in-themiddle (MITM) attacks against a hijack communication between UAV and Ground Control Stations (GCS). Facilitated by an edge server equipped with finely tuned LLMs, Net-GPT crafts mimicked network packets between UAV and GCS. Leveraging the adaptability of popular LLMs, Net-GPT produces context-aligned network packets. We fine-tune and assess Net-GPT's LLM-based efficacy, showing its impressive generative accuracy: 95.3% for Llama-213B and 94.1% for Llama-2-7B. Smaller LLMs, such as Distil-GPT-2, reach 77.9% predictive capability of Llama-2-7B but are 47x faster. Cost-efficiency tests highlight model quality's impact on accuracy while fine-tuning data quantity enhances predictability on specific metrics. It holds great potential to be used in edge-computing environments with amplified computing capability.

Cloud-assisted smart healthcare (s-healthcare) systems have made it easier to store EHRs effectively. However, the traditional encryption algorithms used to secure this data can be vulnerable to attacks if the encryption key is compromised, posing a security threat. A secured cloud-based medical data-sharing system is proposed using a hybrid encryption model called A-BRSA, which combines attribute-based encryption (ABE) and B-RSA encryption. The system utilises the Salp-Ant Lion Optimisation Algorithm for optimal key selection. The encrypted data is stored in the cloud and transmitted to the recipient, where it is decrypted using A-BRSA-based decryption. The study measures turnaround time, encryption time, decryption time, and restoration efficiency to evaluate the system's performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the A-BRSA model in ensuring secure medical data sharing in cloud-based s-healthcare systems.

At the outset, the cyber attack detection capability of the unknown input observer (UIO) is improved with the combination of the neighboring state augmentation and redundancy detection techniques. This is followed by the design of a Luenberger observer(LO)-based fault detection strategy that integrates both the physical-interlinked information with neighbors and the local output collections, thus ensuring robust fault detection performance, even amidst attacks. Expanding on this, residual-based distinguishable attack and fault detection metrics are devised and the interoperability of the dual UIO and LO guarantees the simultaneous differentiation of interleaved-action faults and cyber attacks. Concluding the discourse, the results from case study in ICPSs validate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for detection, which utilizes a dual observer-based approach for distinct identification.

J	Finder, I; Sheetrit, E; Nissim, N				Finder, Ido; Sheetrit, Eitam; Nissim, Nir			Time-interval temporal patterns can beat and explain the malware	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Malware; Detection; Time series; Time interval; Machine learning	SYSTEM; INFORMATION	Malware-based cyber-attacks are mainly aimed at obtaining sensitive data, intellectual property theft, denying critical services and data, and financial gain. Malware has continuously evolved, becoming more sophisticated and evasive, and thus it remains a major cyber-security threat. To keep pace with malware's evolution, there is a critical need to develop new, advanced malware detection methods. Widely-used solutions, such as antivirus software and other static host-based intrusion detection systems, have limitations, particularly in detecting new, unknown, and evasive malware. Many of the limitations of static analysis can be overcome when dynamic malware analysis is leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms by executing the malware in an isolated environment (e.g., sandbox), which enables the acquisition of rich behavioral and time-oriented information associated with malware behavior. Prior studies have proposed various detection methods based on dynamically extracted API calls for malware detection, but other than simple order-based approaches, the use of more advanced time-based methods has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a more comprehensive detection framework which, by analyzing the raw multivariate time-series data associated with malware execution, can accurately capture malware behavior and provide clear explainability regarding malware behavior and detection model decisions. We are the first to mine and automatically discover meaningful and explainable time-interval temporal API call patterns associated with malware behavior and leverage them, using a variety of ML algorithms, for malware detection and categorization. To evaluate our proposed solution, we established a comprehensive dynamic-analysis environment using Cuckoo Sandbox and analyzed more than 17,000 portable executables executed in Windows 10, the most widely-used operating system today. We conducted extensive experiments on malware detection and categorization and compared the performance of our solution to state-of-the-art methods, including non-time-oriented (classic ML algorithms) and order-based methods (LSTM networks). The results show that our proposed solution outperforms the other methods, obtaining 99.6% detection accuracy for unknown malware and 97.65% categorization accuracy. In a more complex scenario of detecting an unknown malware type with unseen modus operandi, our method obtained almost 90% detection accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. To demonstrate our ability to provide human explainability, we present some temporal patterns of different malware families that we discovered which shed light on malware behavior that can be used by cyber-security experts to better understand malware, better defend against future attacks, and even attribute malware campaigns to the cyber-attackers launching them.

Existing solutions typically focus on finding certain vulnerabilities in certain computer systems without giving a systematic way of handling different types of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically modeling and detecting potential security vulnerabilities during the construction of programs using a particular programming paradigm known as Human-Machine Pair Programming. The framework provides designers with a general way of modeling a class of attacks in detail, and shows how programmers can discover and fix a vulnerability in a timely manner. Specifically, our framework advocates three primary steps: (1) generating an attack tree to model a given security threat, (2) constructing vulnerability-matching patterns based on the result of the attack tree analysis, and (3) detecting corresponding vulnerabilities based on the patterns during the program construction.

Blockchain technology plays a vital role in various appli-cations like artificial intelligence, supply chain, cloud computing, the healthcare sector, and many more. It helps the healthcare domain to get benefitted from its many advanced features, such as confidentiality, decentralization, security, and privacy. Also, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices connect with the healthcare systems, and the healthcare sector application software further communicates with the IT industry. The blockchain-based IoT systems have significantly impacted the healthcare sector by enhancing security, privacy, transparency, and efficiency, providing better business opportunities. Moreover, traditional healthcare systems face severe security and privacy problems, such as phishing, masquerades, identity theft, and many others. Thus, a secure blockchain-based Proposed Application (PA) is designed to generate, maintain, and validate healthcare certificates. The PA acts as a communication medium between the backend blockchain network and application entities like hospitals, patients, doctors, and IoT devices to create and verify medical certificates. It also ensures various security features, namely confi-dentiality, authentication, and access control, using the concept of smart contracts. The comparative and performance analysis of the proposed work shows that it provides a more effective solution than the existing schemes.

This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors "anchor nodes" and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80% for GCN and other three models.

The aim of this paper is to provide a solution to the application-level DDoS attack, which is increasingly difficult to detect because botnets tend to get confused with various legitimate users. The proposed solution aims to study the behavior of users and bots, through a User Behavior Analytics (UBA) solution by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to provide a potentially ideal solution to mitigate this type of attack. Accuracy, precision and recall were used to evaluate the model. The values of the three metrics resulting from the training of the model are all very high, which makes us understand that the model reacts well to illicit users but at the same time it does not exchange the licit users for malicious ones.

However, majority of these methods require a significant prior knowledge of malware properties to identify optimal features for malware detection. This is a more significant challenge in IoT environment due to limited availability of malware samples. Some researchers utilized data deformation techniques such as converting malware to images or music to generate features that can be used for malware detection. However, these processes can be time-consuming and require a significant amount of data. This paper proposes MalGan, a framework for detecting and generating new malware samples based on the raw byte code at the edge layer of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was utilized to extract high-level features, and boundary-seeking Generative Adversarial Network technique was used to generate new malware samples. Thus, even with a few malware samples, a significant number of previously unseen malware samples are detectable with high accuracy. To capture the short-term and long-term dependency of features, we employed an attention-based model, a combination of CNN and Long Short Term Memory. The attention mechanism improves the model's performance by increasing or decreasing attention to certain parts of the features. The proposed method is examined extensively using standard Windows and IoT malware datasets. The experimental results indicate that our proposed MalGan is the method of choice, as it offers a higher detection rate compared to the previous malware detection algorithms.

The increasing usage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within a network has contributed to the rise of network intrusion issues due to malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Generally, malicious URLs are initiated to promote scams, attacks, and frauds which can lead to high-risk intrusion. Several methods have been developed to detect malicious URLs in previous works. There has been a good amount of work done to detect malicious URLs using various methods such as random forest, regression, LightGBM, and more as reported in the literature. However, most of the previous works focused on the binary classification of malicious URLs and are tested on limited URL datasets. Nevertheless, the detection of malicious URLs remains a challenging task that remains open to research. Hence, this work proposed a stacking-based ensemble classifier to perform multi-class classification of malicious URLs on larger URL datasets to justify the robustness of the proposed method. This study focuses on obtaining lexical features directly from the URL to identify malicious websites. Then, the proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier is developed by integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, hyperparameter tuning was performed using the Randomized Search method to optimize the proposed classifier. The proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier aims to take advantage of the performance of each machine learning model and aggregate the output to improve prediction accuracy. The classification accuracies of the machine learning model when applied individually are 93.6%, 95.2%, 95.7% and 94.8% for random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost respectively. The proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier has shown significant results in classifying four classes of malicious URLs (phishing, malware, defacement, and benign) with an average accuracy of 96.8% when benchmarked with previous works.

Although X-ray baggage monitoring is now standard, manual screening has several limitations, including the propensity for errors, and raises concerns about passenger privacy. To address these drawbacks, researchers have leveraged recent advances in deep learning to design threat-segmentation frameworks. However, these models require extensive training data and labour-intensive dense pixel-wise annotations and are finetuned separately for each dataset to account for inter-dataset discrepancies. Hence, this study proposes a semi-supervised contour-driven broad learning system (BLS) for X-ray baggage security threat instance segmentation referred to as C-BLX. The research methodology involved enhancing representation learning and achieving faster training capability to tackle severe occlusion and class imbalance using a single training routine with limited baggage scans. The proposed framework was trained with minimal supervision using resource-efficient image-level labels to localize illegal items in multi-vendor baggage scans. More specifically, the framework generated candidate region segments from the input X-ray scans based on local intensity transition cues, effectively identifying concealed prohibited items without entire baggage scans. The multi-convolutional BLS exploits the rich complementary features extracted from these region segments to predict object categories, including threat and benign classes. The contours corresponding to the region segments predicted as threats were then utilized to yield the segmentation results. The proposed C-BLX system was thoroughly evaluated on three highly imbalanced public datasets and surpassed other competitive approaches in baggage-threat segmentation, yielding 90.04%, 78.92%, and 59.44% in terms of mIoU on GDXray, SIXray, and Compass-XP, respectively.

However, designing such features is a time consuming and labor intensive process. This paper proposes an approach named NeuralAS (Neural Anti-Spoofing) by segmenting URLs into word sequences and detecting spoofed URLs with recurrent neural networks. As a result, NeuralAS can perform detection with high-abstract and poor-interpretable features learned automatically, and achieve accurate detection with contextual information in sequences. We also propose a novel method to construct indistinguishable data sets of strong similar samples, which can be used to evaluate the robustness of different approaches. Extensive experimental results show that NeuralAS works well on spoofed URLs detection, and has a significant effectiveness and robustness even on strong similar data sets.

However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams.

The integration of artificial intelligence technologies, including dialogue and voice generation systems, renders the robocalls more deceptive. Existing countermeasures such as caller ID, call provenance, voiceprint, and fake voice detection have respective limitations and are heavyweight for end users' smartphones. This paper studies detecting the acoustic echo channel on the remote end of a call based on the received voice. The positive detection result evidencing the physical setup of an audio system is indicative of a human caller. However, the acoustic echo cancellation mechanisms of most audio systems and the use of earphone/headset diminish echoes significantly. To address these issues, the proposed Telesonar transmits short chirps during the vulnerable time of echo cancellation, detects the tiny echo remnants from the received voice, and passively analyzes the timing of caller's breath sounds to confirm a human caller. Extensive real experiments under a wide range of settings show that Telesonar correctly recognizes human callers with a rate of over 95%, while wrongly recognizing voice robots as human with a rate of 3.8%.

Accordingly, remotely implemented malicious interventions are in the focus of our study, especially considering cyberattacks on connected and autonomous vehicles. To introduce the expected impact of the analysed cyberattacks, certain cyberattack types are demonstrated in the paper. In the paper, malicious interventions are assumed to attack the transport network contrary to the individual road users, which assumption can strongly increase the risk of a given cyber-incident. To illustrate the effect of the evaluated cyberattacks, the transport system of Budapest is used. According to the results, some of the interventions might not be effective, while some of them can expectedly significantly increase travel time values of the network.

Sometimes, the affected organizations can detect these attacks in advance, with the help of cyberthreat intelligence derived from the explicit and implicit features of hacker communication in these forums. Herein, we proposed a novel text-mining based cyber-risk assessment and mitigation framework, which performs the following critical tasks. (i) Cyber-risk Assessment - to identify hacker expertise (i.e., newbie, beginner, intermediate, and advanced) using explicit and implicit features applying various classification algorithms. Among these features, cybersecurity keywords, sharing of attachments, and sentiments emerged as significant. Further, we found that expert hackers demonstrate leadership in the online forums that eventually serve as communities of practice. Consequently, novice hackers gradually develop their cyber-attack skills through prolonged observations, interactions, and external influences in this social learning process. (ii) Cyber-risk mitigation - computes financial impact for every {hacker expertise, attack-type} combination, and then by ranking them on a {likelihood, impact} decision-matrix to prioritize mitigation strategies in affected organizations. Through these novel recommendations, our framework can guide managers to decide on appropriate cybersecurity controls using an {expected loss, probability, attack-type, hacker expertise} metric against financial losses due to cyber-attacks.

The authors' goal is to identify artificial intelligence apps that provide the most reliable and valuable data-based fault detection techniques. A system for fault identification is presented based on reinforcement learning and proximal policy optimisation (PPO). Due to the lack of fault data, one of the key issues with the standard policy is its inability to recognise fault classes; this issue was resolved by modifying the cost equation. Using improved PPO, the authors can improve performance, address data imbalances, and forecast possible failures more accurately. The approach utilises policy-based optimisation, which offers several advantages. Firstly, it directly optimises the advantage quantity, and secondly, it ensures the stability of function approximation. The authors have studied two different turbines in Iran and collected data from them separately when a fault occurred. To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, the authors have included the third and fourth datasets as cyber attack benchmarks. When the authors' proposed policy is adopted, all evaluation metrics will improve by 3%-4% as compared to the previous policy in the first benchmark, between 20% and 55% in the second benchmark, between 6% and 14% in the third benchmark, and between 4% and 5% in the fourth benchmark, with improved results and prediction times compared to existing studies. How proximal policy optimisation, a reinforcement learning policy, can be used for fault detection in data-based approaches and how modifying the cost function can improve performance is illustrated, which is imperative for timely diagnosis of faults. image	[Modirrousta, Mohammad Hossein] K N Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Shoorehdeli, Mahdi Aliyari; Yari, Mostafa] K N Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Mechatron Engn, Tehran, Iran	K.

This increase in complexity and cyber-attack surface demands better understanding of these systems' breakdown dynamics under extreme circumstances. Existing ESCS research largely overlooks simulation and the little work that exists focuses primarily on cybersecurity threats and neglects critical factors such as non-stationarity of call arrivals. This paper introduces a robust, adaptable graph-based simulation framework and essential mathematical models for ESCS simulation. The framework uses a representation of ESCSes where each vertex is a communicating finite-state machine that exchanges messages along edges and whose behavior is governed by a discrete event queuing model. Call arrival burstiness and its connection to emergency incidents is modeled through a cluster point process. Model applicability is demonstrated through simulations of the Seattle Police Department ESCS. Ongoing work is developing GPU implementation and exploring use in cybersecurity tabletop exercises.

This has led to a shift toward passwordless authentication, an approach that promises enhanced security and user experience. This paper provides a comprehensive review of passwordless authentication techniques, analysing their application in user identity verification across multiple platforms. Various methods such as biometrics, security keys, and token-based systems are explored for their efficacy in mitigating security vulnerabilities. The review highlights the advantages of passwordless authentication, including improved security, reduced user friction, and compatibility with modern identity management frameworks like FIDO2. Challenges such as usability issues, cost of deployment, and scalability are also discussed. Moreover, the paper identifies future research areas aimed at overcoming these challenges and facilitating the broad adoption of passwordless authentication in critical industries such as healthcare, finance, and public services. Future opportunities are outlined, emphasizing the need for real-world implementation, enhanced scalability, integration of AI-driven adaptive mechanisms, and innovative designs to improve user accessibility and system resilience. By consolidating existing knowledge and identifying gaps in current solutions, this study provides valuable insights for researchers and industry stakeholders seeking to enhance security through passwordless systems.

By detecting and analyzing malicious URL's characteristics, the semantic and visual information will be extracted. First, a visualization algorithm is used to realize the visualization of the URL mapping to a gray image with texture characteristics. Second, the lexical feature and character feature of URL are extracted and further processed through word vector technology. These extracted features are transformed into lexical embedding vectors and character embedding vectors. To combine the texture features with text features, a parallel joint neural network combining capsule network (CapsNet) and independent recurrent neural network (IndRNN) is utilized to capture multi-modal vectors of visual and semantic information synchronously. The last layer utilizes the attention mechanism to further filter the deep features extracted from the overall network while concentrating on effective features improving the classification accuracy and analyzing and detect malicious URLs. Based on the experimental results, it is demonstrated that this algorithm has higher accuracy compared to the traditional algorithms.

Most deep learning-based methods for physical and digital adversarial attacks focus on enhancing attack performance by crafting adversarial examples that contain large printable distortions that are easy for human observers to identify. However, attackers rarely impose limitations on the naturalness and comfort of the appearance of the generated attack image, resulting in a noticeable and unnatural attack. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to incorporate style transfer to craft adversarial inputs of natural styles that exhibit minimal detectability and maximum natural appearance, while maintaining superior attack capabilities.

The Role of IT Background for Metacognitive Accuracy, Confidence and Overestimation of Deep Fake Recognition Skills	AUGMENTED COGNITION, AC 2022	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Augmented Cognition (AC) Held as Part of the 24th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII)	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2022	ELECTR NETWORK			Metacognition; Deep fake; Cybersecurity; Social engineering	MODEL	The emergence of synthetic media such as deep fakes is considered to be a disruptive technology shaping the fight against cybercrime as well as enabling political disinformation. Deep faked material exploits humans' interpersonal trust and is usually applied where technical solutions of deep fake authentication are not in place, unknown, or unaffordable. Improving the individual's ability to recognise deep fakes where they are not perfectly produced requires training and the incorporation of deep fake-based attacks into social engineering resilience training. Individualised or tailored approaches as part of cybersecurity awareness campaigns are superior to a one-size-fits-all approach, and need to identify persons in particular need for improvement. Research conducted in phishing simulations reported that persons with educational and/or professional background in information technology frequently underperform in social engineering simulations. In this study, we propose a method and metric to detect overconfident individuals in regards to deep fake recognition. The proposed overconfidence score flags individuals overestimating their performance and thus posing a previously unconsidered cybersecurity risk. In this study, and in line with comparable research from phishing simulations, individuals with IT background were particularly prone to overconfidence. We argue that this data-driven approach to identifying persons at risk enables educators to provide a more targeted education, evoke insight into own judgement deficiencies, and help to avoid the self-selection bias typical for voluntary participation.

The usage and importance of e-mails continuously grow despite the prevalence of alternative means, such as electronic messages, mobile applications, and social networks. As the volume of business-critical e-mails continues to grow, the need to automate the management of e-mails increases for several reasons, such as spam e-mail classification, phishing e-mail classification, and multi-folder categorization, among others. This paper comprehensively reviews articles on e-mail classification published in 2006-2016 by exploiting the methodological decision analysis in five aspects, namely, e-mail classification application areas, data sets used in each application area, feature space utilized in each application area, e-mail classification techniques, and the use of performance measures. A total of 98 articles (56 articles from Web of Science core collection databases and 42 articles from Scopus database) are selected. To achieve the objective of the study, a comprehensive review and analysis is conducted to explore the various areas where e-mail classification was applied. Moreover, various public data sets, features sets, classification techniques, and performance measures are examined and used in each identified application area. This review identifies five application areas of e-mail classification. The most widely used data sets, features sets, classification techniques, and performance measures are found in the identified application areas. The extensive use of these popular data sets, features sets, classification techniques, and performance measures is discussed and justified. The research directions, research challenges, and open issues in the field of e-mail classification are also presented for future researchers.

But among these visitors there is also a big number of manipulators that try to benefit from the others for many reasons, which leads to increase the need to detect the fake accounts that try to manipulate over the online social media (OSN). A malicious account on OSNs can be created for different objectives such as social spam, identity theft, spear phishing and sybil attacks. In this article, we study and analyze the multiple fake accounts created by one user in order to manipulate and bypass the OSN regulation. We present a new methodology to detect the multiple identity fake accounts and validate it on a set of 10000 accounts extracted from English Wikipedia (EnWiki). In this methodology, we propose a set of features that differentiate between fake and legitimate accounts and grows on previous literature, then we train and test them using machine learning algorithms. The results compare several machine learning algorithms to show that our new features and training data enable to detect 99% of fake accounts, improving previous results from the literature.

Considerable research efforts have gone into developing methodologies for detecting HTs. A significant issue in validating HT detection algorithms is the lack of open-source benchmarks with the complexity of modern-day System-on-Chips (SoCs). The currently available open-source benchmarks are more elementary and, therefore, do not reveal the actual robustness of the algorithms against false positives and false negatives. To address this issue, we present the design and integration of three kinds of HTs (publicly available at [38]) in a RISC-V-based SoC. We explain their functionality and taxonomy in detail. To our knowledge, this work is the first to launch trojan attacks targeting the mismatch in the attributes of two widely used on-chip communication protocols in an SoC. We performed extensive behavioral simulations to verify the functionality of these kinds of SoC-level HTs. We estimated the detectability of these HTs by: (i) synthesizing the HT-infested SoC for FPGA and (ii) evaluating them against a Graph Neural Network-based pre-Silicon HT detection tool, automatic test pattern generation, reverse engineering, and formal verification. In a nutshell, this paper demonstrates the risk of HTs in today's SoCs and an effective environment for strengthening research on HT detection.

As dependency on critical services provided by software systems grows globally, a potential security threat in such systems poses higher and higher risks (e.g. economical damage, a threat to human life, criminal activity). Finding potential security vulnerabilities at the code level automatically is a very popular approach to aid security testing. However, most of the methods based on machine learning and statistical models stop at listing potentially vulnerable code parts and leave their validation and mitigation to the developers. Automatic program repair could fill this gap by automatically generating vulnerability mitigation code patches. Nonetheless, it is still immature, especially in targeting security-relevant fixes. In this work, we try to establish a path towards automatic vulnerability fix generation techniques in the context of JavaScript programs. We inspect 361 actual vulnerability mitigation patches collected from vulnerability databases and GitHub. We found that vulnerability mitigation patches are not short on average and in many cases affect not just program code but test code as well. These results point towards that a general automatic repair approach targeting all the different types of vulnerabilities is not feasible. The analysis of the code properties and fix patterns for different vulnerability types might help in setting up a more realistic goal in the area of automatic JavaScript vulnerability repair.

Social media is an important pillar of this revolution and has brought profound changes to various aspects of our lives. However, the open environment and popularity of these platforms inaugurate windows of opportunities for various cyber threats, thus social networks have become a fertile venue for spammers and other illegitimate users to execute their malicious activities. These activities include phishing hot and trendy topics and posting a wide range of contents in many topics. Hence, it is crucial to continuously introduce new techniques and approaches to detect and stop this category of users. This article proposes a novel and effective approach to detect social spammers. An investigation into several attributes to measure topic-dependent and topic-independent users' behaviours on Twitter is carried out. The experiments of this study are undertaken on various machine learning classifiers. The performance of these classifiers is compared and their effectiveness is measured via a number of robust evaluation measures. Furthermore, the proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art social spam and anomalous detection techniques. These experiments report the effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach and embedded modules.

While we benefit from such techniques in many ways, they can be a serious security threat to the Internet if malicious attackers become able to utilize them to discover unknown software vulnerabilities. This paper introduces a new concept of self-evolving botnets, where computing resources of infected hosts are exploited to discover unknown vulnerabilities in non-infected hosts and the botnets evolve autonomously. We provide a stochastic epidemic model for the self-evolving botnets, and show its behaviors through numerical and simulation experiments.

However, this vision can only be safely realized if user safety and privacy are prioritized. This review critically evaluates existing user safety and security measures within the Metaverse. We have highlighted the limited ability of existing solutions to protect against harassment, identity theft, and the misuse of personal data collected in this environment. This research comprehensively analyzes user safety and security dimensions within virtual worlds and presents a taxonomy to classify the unique threats and vulnerabilities Metaverse users may encounter. This review reveals critical gaps, including the lack of comprehensive security frameworks and balanced privacy-preserving models in virtual immersive environments. In response, we propose a novel Metaverse Security Architecture designed with Zero-Trust principles. This architecture prioritizes user control over data, identity, and experiences. It also emphasizes proactive security measures to mitigate diverse potential harms in virtual worlds.

Many interpretation methods help to understand the decision-making of DNNs by generating saliency maps that highlight parts of the input image that contribute the most to the prediction made by the DNN. In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image with a specific trigger pattern while not losing the prediction performance significantly. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: a targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and a non-targeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluations of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based interpretation methods, Grad-CAM and SimpleGrad, and a gradient-free scheme, VisualBackProp, for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat to the reliability of the interpretation methods when deploying models developed by untrusted sources. We furthermore show that existing backdoor defense mechanisms are ineffective in detecting our attacks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users.

However, despite its utility, email faces significant challenges due to the widespread presence of spam in various forms, such as phishing, suspicious attachments and deceptive content. This issue not only affects the efficiency and security of email communication but also poses a barrier to its reliability. Therefore, it is essential to devise effective methods to tackle the escalating count of spam emails. This research work presents an intriguing methodology to combat the persistent problem of email spam. The proposed method, abbreviated as AIGSADT, is an amalgamation of the intelligent variant of the gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) and decision trees (DTs). The machine learning-based DT algorithm is individually inadequate for dealing with the large amount of constructive data on a certain attribute due to its instability and ineffectiveness. The proposed AIGSADT approach integrates the IGSA algorithm, which is effective in handling large amounts of data to detect email spam. This is achieved by constructing decision trees employing gravitational forces as the means of information transfer through mass agents. Here, the intelligent factor of the IGSA algorithm prevents the trapping of GSA agents in local optima by updating their positions based on information provided by the best and worst agents. The performance of the presented AIGSADT approach is analyzed through experiments conducted on various categories available in the Ling spam dataset.

Cloud computing services offer an extensive range of resource pool in order to maintain huge scale data. Although, cloud computing model is disposed to several cyber-attacks and security problems regarding cloud structure, because of the dynamic and distribute character and exposures in virtualization implementation. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber-attack, which disturbs the usual traffic of targeted cloud server. Moreover, DDoS produces malicious traffic in cloud structure, and thus consumes cloud resources. In this paper, an effective DDoS attack detection model, named fractional anti corona virus student psychology optimization-based deep residual network (FACVSPO-based DRN) is implemented using spark architecture. The devised FACVSPO approach is newly designed by incorporating anti coronavirus optimization (ACVO) algorithm, fractional calculus (FC) and student psychology based optimization (SPBO) model. Moreover, the hybrid correlative scheme is designed for extracting significant features for attack detection. The DRN structure is utilized for performing attack recognition, which categorizes the data as normal or attack. In addition, the DRN classifier is trained by the developed FACVSPO approach. The developed attack detection model outperformed other existing techniques in terms of testing accuracy, true negative rate (TNR), true positive rate (TPR) of 0.9236, 0.9141, and 0.9412, respectively. The testing accuracy of the implemented model is 12.02%, 8.92%, 7.27%, 6.30%, 5.68%, and 1.20% better than the existing methods, such as Taylor-elephant herd optimisation based deep belief network (TEHO-DBN), deep learning, deep neural network (DNN), multiple kernel learning, Fuzzy Taylor elephant herd optimisation (EHO)-based DBN, fractional anti corona virus optimization-deep neuro fuzzy network (FACVO-based DNFN), respectively. Similarly, the TNR is 10.14%, 6.88%, 5.94%, 5.46%, 4.25%, and 3.28% and TPR is 12.33%, 9.46%, 8.05%, 7.41%, 6.02%, and 3.04% better than the existing methods.

Thus, the need for a reliable and acceptable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) solution is becoming urgent to protect the networks and devices. However, implementing a robust IDS needs a reliable and up-to-date dataset in order to capture the behaviors of the new types of attacks especially a multi-step attack. In this paper, a new benchmark Multi-Step Cyber-Attack Dataset (MSCAD) is introduced. MSCAD includes two multi-step scenarios; the first scenario is a password cracking attack, and the second attack scenario is a volume-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The MSCAD was assessed in two manners; firstly, the MSCAD was used to train IDS. Then, the performance of IDS was evaluated in terms of G-mean and Area Under Curve (AUC). Secondly, the MSCAD was compared with other free open-source and public datasets based on the latest keys criteria of a dataset evaluation framework. The results show that IDS-based MSCAD achieved the best performance with G-mean 0.83 and obtained good accuracy to detect the attacks. Besides, the MSCAD successfully passing twelve keys criteria.

Existing adversarial attacks against lane detection often simplify it as a certain type of computer vision task and ignore its crosstask characteristic, resulting in weak transferability, poor stealthiness, and low executability. This paper proposes a cross-task physical adversarial attack scheme based on LED illumination modulation (AdvLIM) after analyzing the decision behavior coexisting in lane detection models. We generate imperceptible brightness flicker through fast intensity modulation of LED illumination and utilize the rolling shutter effect of the CMOS image sensor to inject brightness information perturbations into the captured scene image. According to different modulation parameters, this paper proposes two attack strategies: scatter attack and dense attack. Cross-task attack experiments are conducted on the Tusimple dataset on five lane detection models of three different task types, including segmentation-based models (SCNN, RESA), point detection-based model (LaneATT), and curve-based models (LSTR, BezierLaneNet). The experimental results show that AdvLIM causes a detection accuracy drop of 77.93%, 75.86%, 51.51%, 89.41%, and 73.94% for the above models respectively. Experiments are also conducted in the physical world, and the results indicate that AdvLIM can pose a real and significant security threat to diverse lane detection systems in real-world scenarios.

Your IP Camera Can Be Abused for Payments: A Study of IoT Exploitation for Financial Services Leveraging Shodan and Criminal Infrastructures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Internet of Things; Security; Computer architecture; Dark Web; IP networks; Cryptocurrency; Credit cards; Vectors; Phishing; Object recognition; IoT security; vulnerable IoT devices; IoT abuses; IoT proxies; malicious infrastructure; financial crimes		The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being abused by exploiting their vulnerabilities. Despite the significant efforts to improve IoT security, IoT devices are still at higher risk of exploitation than computer systems. First, this paper identifies vulnerable IoT devices by applying a sampling strategy incorporating Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries, Shodan's exposure, and public research documents. Then, we investigated IoT abuses in financial crimes for 17 months (October 2021 to February 2023) by mapping IoT devices exposed by Shodan with proxies found in the darknet, underground forums, and Telegram channels. After investigation, we conclude with reasonable confidence that exposed IoT devices are taken over and abused as proxies in criminal activities such as credential stuffing attacks and financial crimes like illegal money transfers, cryptocurrency trading and stealing, and credit card fraud. Our study reveals that cameras (IP, network, security) are mostly abused IoT devices as proxies, followed by NAS storage.

In Industry 4.0 era, a cyber-attack becomes unavoidable and needs to adopt cyber supply chain risk management to improve the firm. The data were collected from 105 firms in Malaysia through online surveys. The partial least squares structural equation modeling technique examined the model's goodness and research hypothesis. The results revealed that operations, directly and indirectly, influence (via mediators) supply chain performance. In contrast, governance directly affects supply chain flexibility and indirect (via mediators) influence on supply chain performance; in addition, systems integration did not, directly, and indirectly, influence supply chain performance. This framework indicates the manufacturing industry and related parties with a better understanding of cyber supply chain risk management.

In order to make full use of the renewable energy, various smart Internet of Thing (IoT) devices are deployed. However, in the field of energy management, the two-way mismatch between the demand and the supply of the renewable energy will greatly affect the efficiency of the renewable energy. In addition, the security threat of the energy data and the privacy leakage of the user may hinder the further development of smart IoT devices. Therefore, how to achieve consistency and balance between the demand and the renewable energy supply and how to guarantee the security and privacy of smart IoT devices become the key problems of the energy-efficient smart environment. In this paper, a secure and intelligent energy data management scheme for smart IoT devices is proposed. It is worth noting that, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and secure cryptography primitives, the proposed scheme realizes high-efficient and secure energy utilization in a smart environment. Specifically, the proposed scheme aims at improving the efficiency of the energy utilization in the multidimensions of a smart environment. In order to realize the fine-grain energy management of smart IoT devices, strategies of three different dimensions are considered and realized in the proposed scheme. Moreover, technologies in AI are applied and integrated into the energy management scheme. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can make full use of the renewable energy in smart IoT devices.

Their behaviour initially observed as anomalous may, however, in many cases be rather generic and hard to detect. To be able to address such anomalies, it is instrumental to determine whether the anomaly is a "Security" threat or only a "Performance" concern. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an anomaly detection model capable of distinguishing between security and performance anomalies. The model is based on sequential modeling and Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM), which leverage historical information and dependencies between previous predictions to classify future anomalies accurately. The evaluation of our proposed model shows its superior performance on our testbed and benchmark datasets. Accordingly, the model achieves an average 5%, and 3% higher F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods in binary and multi-label anomaly detection cases, respectively.

Recent studies have demonstrated that injecting malicious packets into in-vehicle networks can cause unintended behaviors of vehicles, and such a security threat is considered as an urgent issue to address in the industry. In this paper, we tackle with the task of detecting injected malicious packets as well as the task of explaining these injected packets, that is, to find which parts of the injected packets are essential in the attack. In contrast with the previous approaches using statistical anomaly detection techniques to find anomalous contents, our approach employs change detection which can detect small changes of frequencies of non-anomalous contents. Especially, our change detection approach is based on a density ratio estimation method using a neural network classifier; therefore, we can interpret the detection results using recent techniques to interpret decisions by deep neural networks. Our experimental results using real CAN packet datasets collected from an actual vehicle facing several kinds of attacks show the advantage of the proposed approach over anomaly detection based methods.

This has given rise to a range of issues, including fake news, academic fraud, phishing emails, posing significant dangers across various domains. However, current machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods still face challenges, including the need to access model's output logits or losses, which makes it unable to adapt to black-box scenarios in the real world, and difficult to deploy models with large parameter sizes. Therefore, we propose a compression-based lightweight network for MGT detection that leverages the ability of lossless compression to effectively extract features between categories. With fewer parameters, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in MGT detection under black box conditions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach performs exceptionally well on both Chinese and English datasets. Specifically, our method achieves a full-text detection accuracy of 99.5%, surpassing the previous SOTA method.

Catching malicious hackers prior to a cyber-attack can save significant financial cost as well as avoid devastating cyber-attacks. Current methods of identifying and reprimanding hackers generally occurs after an attack and is reactive in nature. This research aims to proactively identify key hackers who are creating and disseminating malicious tools within hacker forums. Specifically, we utilize social network analysis techniques to systematically identify key hackers for keylogging tools within a large English hacker forum. Results of this study indicate that many key hackers are the most senior, longest tenured participants of their community.

We use the sViBe background modeling method to generate a long-term and a short-term background model to extract foreground objects. Subsequently, a pixel-based FSM detects stationary candidate objects based on the temporal transition of code patterns. In order to classify the stationary candidate objects, we use deep learning method (SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector) to detect person and some suspected type of objects which include backpack, handbag. In order to suppress any false alarm, we remove other stationary candidate objects other than the suspected stationary objects. After stationary object detection, we also check if there is no person near by the suspected detected objects for a particular time. We tested the system on four standard public datasets. The results show that our method outperforms the performance of existing results while also being robust to temporary occlusions and illumination changes.

This study examines different attribution techniques, obstacles, and real-world examples in the context of cyber warfare. It explores challenges such as incorrect attributions, ethical concerns, legal barriers, and complexities in the digital environment. The discussed topic includes modern techniques such as malware analysis, network traffic study, digital forensics, and the implementation of AI/ML. These methods help improve cybersecurity and shape cyber warfare strategies. Case studies on the Standard Bank South Africa ATM fraud and the TransUnion South Africa cyber-attack illustrate the importance of attributing cyber incidents, especially with global cyber criminals. The analysis emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach that takes into account legal, technical, ethical, and geopolitical considerations relevant to the evolution of computing and cyber warfare. It stresses the need for cybersecurity tools enhancement and global cooperation. The study pairs attribution challenges with techniques to deepen our understanding of threats.

The methods currently used for botnet detection are only appropriate for specific botnet commands and control protocols; they do not endorse botnet identification in early phases. Security guards have used honeypots successfully in several computer security defence systems. Honeypots are frequently utilised in botnet defence because they can draw botnet compromises, reveal spies in botnet membership, and deter attacker behaviour. Attackers who build and maintain botnets must devise ways to avoid honeypot traps. Machine learning methods support identification and inhibit bot threats to address the problems associated with botnet attacks. To choose the best features to feed as input to the machine learning classifiers to estimate the performance of botnet detection, a Kernel-based Ensemble Meta Classifier (KEMC) Strategy is suggested in this work. And particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) intelligent optimization algorithms are used to establish the ideal order. The model covered in this paper is employed to forecast Internet cyber security circumstances. The Binary Cross-Entropy (loss), the GA-PSO optimizer, the Softsign activation functions and ensembles were used in the experiment to produce the best results. The model succeeded because Forfileless malware, gathered from well-known datasets, achieved a total accuracy of 93.3% with a True Positive (TP) Range of 87.45% at zero False Positive (FP).

The digitization of the supply chain is a potential major target for cryptojacking due to the large number of different infrastructures involved. These different infrastructures provide information sources that can be useful to detect cryptojacking, but with a wide variety of data formats and encodings. This paper describes the Semantic Data Aggregator (SDA), a normalization and aggregation system based on data modelling and low-latency processing of data streams that facilitates the integration of heterogeneous information sources. As a use case, the paper describes a Cryptomining Detection System (CDS) based on network traffic flows processed by a machine learning engine. The results show how the SDA is leveraged in this use case to obtain aggregated information that improves the performance of the CDS.

In the last decade, deep learning has arisen as a new kind of artificial intelligence technique that expresses power grid datasets via an extensive hypothesis space, resulting in an outstanding performance in comparison with the majority of recent algorithms. This paper investigates the theoretical benefits of deep data representation in the study of power networks. We examine deep learning techniques described and deployed in a variety of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning scenarios. We explore different scenarios in which discriminative deep frameworks, such as Stacked Autoencoder networks and Convolution Networks, and generative deep architectures, including Deep Belief Networks and Variational Autoencoders, solve problems. This study's empirical and theoretical evaluation of deep learning encourages long-term studies on improving this modern category of methods to accomplish substantial advancements in the future of electrical systems.

Considerableamount of unsolicited mail flows into user's mail boxes on adaily basis. A major negative aspect since the past decade has been bulk spam or phishing mail. Besides such unsolicited spam emails being wearisome for many email users, it also puts pressure on the IT infrastructure of organizations and costs businesses billions of dollars in lost efficiency. Increasing need of effectively filtering spamhas become vital. We thus use BPNN filtering algorithm i.e.Artificial Neural Network Feed forward with Back Propagation, whichis based on text classification to classify significant emails from unsolicited ones.

The digitization of the supply chain is a potential major target for cryptojacking due to the large number of different infrastructures involved. These different infrastructures provide information sources that can be useful to detect cryptojacking, but with a wide variety of data formats and encodings. This paper describes the semantic data aggregator (SDA), a normalization and aggregation system based on data modelling and low-latency processing of data streams that facilitates the integration of heterogeneous information sources. As a use case, the paper describes a cryptomining detection system (CDS) based on network traffic flows processed by a machine learning engine. The results show how the SDA is leveraged in this use case to obtain aggregated information that improves the performance of the CDS.

J	Rhmann, W				Rhmann, Wasiur			Software Vulnerability Prediction Using Grey Wolf-Optimized Random Forest on the Unbalanced Data Sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED METAHEURISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Grey Wolf; Machine Learning Techniques; Prediction; Random Forest; Vulnerability	METRICS; VALIDATION; MODEL	Any vulnerability in the software creates a software security threat and helps hackers to gain unauthorized access to resources. Vulnerability prediction models help software engineers to effectively allocate their resources to find any vulnerable class in the software before its delivery to customers. Vulnerable classes must be carefully reviewed by security experts and tested to identify potential threats that may arise in the future. In the present work, a novel technique based on grey wolf algorithm and random forest is proposed for software vulnerability prediction. Grey wolf technique is a metaheuristic technique, and it is used to select the best subset of features. The proposed technique is compared with other machine learning techniques. Experiments were performed on three datasets available publicly. It was observed that the proposed technique (GW-RF) outperformed all other techniques for software vulnerability prediction.

J	Gu, YH; Bai, YB				Gu, Yuhao; Bai, Yuebin			LR-BA: Backdoor attack against vertical federated learning using local latent representations	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Vertical federated learning; Backdoor attack; Backdoor defense; Federated learning security; Artificial intelligence security		In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple participants can collaborate in training a model with dis-tributed data features and labels managed by one of them. The cooperation provides opportunities for malicious participant to conduct a backdoor attack. However, the attack is challenging when the ad-versary does not own labels with the mitigation of other participants. In this paper, we discover that an adversary can exploit local latent representations output in the inference stage to inject a backdoor in VFL, even without access to labels. With little auxiliary labeled data, the adversary fine-tunes its bottom model to make it output specific latent representation for backdoor input instances, which induces the federated model to predict the attacker-specified label regardless of benign participants. Our experiments show that the proposed attack can achieve a high attack success rate with little loss of main task accu-racy and outperform existing backdoor attacks. We also explore possible defenses against the attack. Our research demonstrates the potential security threat to VFL.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Maintaining a high degree of reliability and accuracy in the state estimation process is important in avoiding any disruption in the electricity market operation. The market operation in power networks aims at providing a win-win situation for both the utility and consumer. The exposure and vulnerability of cyber components in smart grids allow for manipulating the electricity market by falsifying the state variables. The attacker can cause intentional profit/loss to the utility/consumer by misdirecting the estimated states through the injection of false data into the sensor information. Hence, maintaining integrity in the market operation demands a mechanism for detecting false data injection attack (FDIA). This paper proposes a classification-based approach for detecting FDIAs aiming at electricity market disruption. For any variation in the predicted and real-time nodal electricity price, the proposed decision tree (DT) based ensemble classifier is executed using state information to identify the prevailing scenario as a contingency or FDIA. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been extensively validated for various contingency and FDIA scenarios in IEEE 14 bus, 39 bus, and 57 bus test power systems.

Those systems make intensive use of data and information and are therefore exposed to more potential cyber attacks. Thereby, the need for reliable approaches to protect them has increased. One of the key elements for guaranteeing the security of cyber systems is to identify the origin (the source) of the attack. In this paper, we describe a new approach to estimate both the source and the start time of a virus outbreak in complex networks (which include cyber systems) using partial information about the diffusion process, obtained through observing only a subset of nodes. Our approach uses a linear regression method on the partial obtained data, based on the fact that there is a linear correlation observed between the relative infection time of a node and its effective distance from the source. The experimental results showed that our approach is able to give an estimation of the source and the start time in, respectively, few hops from the actual source, and few time-units from the real start time.

The performance of the legacy electric network can be enhanced by solving optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problems such as, tuning of the grid voltages, transformers tap setting, capacitor bank rating, allocation and sizing of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) through computational intelligence tools. In last few decades, several optimization strategies are developed to solve ORPD problems but still research is in progress to leverage the performance of power system. In this line of thought, this paper provides a comprehensive literature of major optimization tools designed for the solution of ORPD problems with aim of improving the power system performance. The purpose of this study is to document up to date information on the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD), ORPD incorporating FACTS, mathematical model of ORPD problems with corresponding constraints, mathematical model of FACTS in ORPD, and applications of ORPD. At the end, a new computational tool based on fractional calculus has also been introduced for performance improvement of traditional swarming techniques to support researchers in field of energy/power sector and carry out further research.

Examples for malicious activities based on these networks comprise e.g. phishing, click fraud, spam, command and control structure of botnets. Most of the proposed detection methods rely on machine learning based on complex feature sets which require a considerable computational power. This paper investigates the approach of passively monitoring and analyzing DNS traffic in a time efficient manner based on machine learning on a reduced and robust feature set. For the evaluation the full DNS data stream of a regional ISP is used. To enhance the amount of traffic that can be labeled for the training process and reduce the number of false negatives in the case study, this is combined with a semi-manual labeling approach which addresses domains created by Domain-Generation-Algorithms (DGAs). That allows also medium sized, regional service providers to train classifiers with typical DNS traffic and to deploy systems based on the approach proposed here, in the network of organizations as an alternative to cloud services. The evaluation shows that this approach is feasible and prototypes are already deployed. Hence this approach can serve as an important aspect of the internal risk management of organizations.

While these systems provide invaluable situational awareness and decision-making capabilities, they increasingly become targets for malicious actors aiming to disrupt their normal operations. Electronic countermeasures (ECM) have traditionally been the predominant form of attack. However, recent findings have uncovered their vulnerability to cyber-based actions, capitalizing on their digitization and network connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel threat model that exploits cyber attack capabilities against radar systems to simulate the effects of ECM. This model goes beyond known attacks by introducing a deceptive element, challenging attribution. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, extensive experimentation is conducted using a realistic case study involving the maritime domain. Through this research, we aim to highlight the evolving threats facing radar systems and the need for comprehensive security measures.

J	Farrugia, S; Ellul, J; Azzopardi, G				Farrugia, Steven; Ellul, Joshua; Azzopardi, George			Detection of illicit accounts over the Ethereum blockchain	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Blockchain; Ethereum; Fraud detection; Machine learning; XGBoost		The recent technological advent of cryptocurrencies and their respective benefits have been shrouded with a number of illegal activities operating over the network such as money laundering, bribery, phishing, fraud, among others. In this work we focus on the Ethereum network, which has seen over 400 million transactions since its inception. Using 2179 accounts flagged by the Ethereum community for their illegal activity coupled with 2502 normal accounts, we seek to detect illicit accounts based on their transaction history using the XGBoost classifier. Using 10 fold cross-validation, XGBoost achieved an average accuracy of 0.963 (+/- 0.006) with an average AUC of 0.994 (+/- 0.0007). The top three features with the largest impact on the final model output were established to be 'Time diffbetween first and last (Mins)', 'Total Ether balance' and 'Min value received'. Based on the results we conclude that the proposed approach is highly effective in detecting illicit accounts over the Ethereum network. Our contribution is multi-faceted; firstly, we propose an effective method to detect illicit accounts over the Ethereum network; secondly, we provide insights about the most important features; and thirdly, we publish the compiled data set as a benchmark for future related works.

J	Krupski, J; Graniszewski, W; Iwanowski, M				Krupski, Jacek; Graniszewski, Waldemar; Iwanowski, Marcin			Data Transformation Schemes for CNN-Based Network Traffic Analysis: A Survey	ELECTRONICS			English	Review						network traffic analysis; convolutional neural networks; machine learning; network traffic images; visualization of traffic	DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; INTERNET; FRAMEWORK; ATTACKS	The enormous growth of services and data transmitted over the internet, the bloodstream of modern civilization, has caused a remarkable increase in cyber attack threats. This fact has forced the development of methods of preventing attacks. Among them, an important and constantly growing role is that of machine learning (ML) approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) belong to the hottest ML techniques that have gained popularity, thanks to the rapid growth of computing power available. Thus, it is no wonder that these techniques have started to also be applied in the network traffic classification domain. This has resulted in a constant increase in the number of scientific papers describing various approaches to CNN-based traffic analysis. This paper is a survey of them, prepared with particular emphasis on a crucial but often disregarded aspect of this topic-the data transformation schemes. Their importance is a consequence of the fact that network traffic data and machine learning data have totally different structures. The former is a time series of values-consecutive bytes of the datastream. The latter, in turn, are one-, two- or even three-dimensional data samples of fixed lengths/sizes. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of data transformation schemes. Next, we use this categorization to describe various CNN-based analytical approaches found in the literature.

However, PMUs have a high installation cost prohibiting their massive deployment. Minimizing the number of installed PMUs needs to be achieved while also maintaining full observability of the network. At the same time, data integrity attacks on PMU measurements can cause mislead power system control and operation routines. In this paper, a bi-level stochastic non-cooperative game-based placement model is proposed for PMU allocation in the presence of cyber-attack risks. In the first level, the protection of individual PMU placed in a network is addressed, while considering the interaction between the grid operator and the attacker with respective resource constraints. In the second level, the attacker observes the placement of the PMUs and compromises them, with the aim of maximizing the state estimation error and reducing the observability of the network. The proposed technique is deployed in the IEEE-9 bus test system.

Whether it is a malware attachment or a URL leading to malware, exploitation or phishing, attackers have been employing emails as an effective way to gain a foothold inside organizations of all kinds. To combat email threats, especially targeted attacks, traditional signature-and rule-based email filtering as well as advanced sandboxing technology both have their own weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a predictive analysis approach that learns the differences between legit and malicious emails through static analysis, creates a machine learning model and makes detection and prediction on unseen emails effectively and efficiently. By comparing three different machine learning algorithms, our preliminary evaluation reveals that a Random Forests model performs the best.

The double-layer PUF was reported as a PUF scheme to resist the fully connected artificial neural network based modeling attack, and its test chip was fabricated and tested. This work proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) based modeling method according to the working principle of the target PUF, and successfully attacks the double-layer PUF. To enhance the anti-modeling-attack capability of the double-layer PUF, the address swapping, the XORing, and the dimensional extension techniques are proposed. The attack results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed ANN-based model with the proposed techniques drops obviously. And the prediction accuracy is about 50.04% if all the three proposed techniques are applied in combination. It manifests that the proposed security enhancement techniques are able to improve the resilience of the double-layer PUF against the modeling attacks effectively. Both the randomness and uniqueness of the improved double-layer PUFs are approximate to the ideal value (50%), and the reliability of the improved PUFs remain unchanged compared with the original counterpart because the operations on the resistive random memory (RRAM) array are the same.

This form of attack is known for its persistence, diversity, and stealth, and it results in serious security threats and economic losses for various organizations and institutions. In the face of this threat, tracing the attack chain (i.e., attack investigation) is critical to understanding the attacker's behavior, identifying attack methods and patterns, and taking appropriate defensive measures. However, the current APT attack investigation techniques suffer from insufficient audit log refinement, attack entrance location difficulties, and attack path tracking accuracy challenges. In this paper, we propose LinTracer, which is an efficient attack investigation system based on the ATT&CK attack model for Linux systems that fuses entity and event semantics for cyber-attack chains. First, an auditing mechanism is used to stably collect the kernel data of the target operating system, and data compression techniques are used to refine the log data and reduce the overhead imposed by the attack investigation system. Second, a backward causal analysis is performed from the alarm point to construct a suspicious provenance graph. LinTracer extracts the features used to distinguish between attack events and benign events, calculates the feature scores of the events, and then uses the backward propagation algorithm to propagate the dependency scores backward from the alarm point to identify the attack entry points. Finally, entity semantic labels are designed based on the ATT&CK framework to perform forward label propagation on the attack entry points, ultimately enabling an effective attack investigation. The experimental results derived from laboratory tests and DARPA Engagement (approximately 64 million auditing events obtained from real systems) show that LinTracer has good real-time performance and can accurately identify attack chains.

In this paper, we present a PUF-based authentication method to mitigate the practical limitations in applications where a resource-rich server authenticates a device with no strong restriction imposed on the type of PUF designs or any additional protection on the binary channel used for the authentication. Our scheme uses an active deception protocol to prevent machine learning (ML) attacks on a device. The monolithic system makes collection of challenge response pairs (CRPs) easy for model building during enrollment but prohibitively time consuming upon device deployment. A genuine server can perform a mutual authentication with the device at any time with a combined fresh challenge contributed by both the server and the device.

Malicious users prefer to do malicious activities like phishing, spamming, etc., using compromised websites because they can mask their original identities behind these compromised sites. Compromised websites are more difficult to detect than malicious websites because compromised websites work in masquerade mode. This is one of the main reasons for us to take this topic as our research. This paper introduces the related work first and then introduces a framework to detect compromised websites using link structure analysis. One of the most popular link structures based ranking algorithm used by the Google search engine algorithm called PageRank, is implemented in our experiment using the Java language, computation is done before a website is compromised and after a website is compromised and the results are compared. The results show that when a website is compromised, its PageRank can go do down to indicate that this website is compromised.

The use of deep learning in side-channel analysis makes it easier to compromise the security of cryptographic chips. Although these chips equipped with countermeasures can increase the complexity of side-channel analysis, it is essential to continue exploring and developing more advanced analysis methods for better security. In this brief, we propose a simple residual network called ResNet-S, which has shown strong performance. Based on this foundation, we have developed the dual-path hybrid residual network. The dual-path hybrid convolution technique is used for feature fusion. It utilizes a multi-scale convolution strategy to effectively reduces the required number of traces for key recovery. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed neural networks on different datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed networks outperform the state-of-the-art neural networks that have been published.

Traditional studies are limited by their reliance on comprehensive historical data and address-wise manipulation, which are not available for early malice detection and fail to identify addresses controlled by the same fraudulent entity. We thus introduce Evolve Path Tracer, a novel solution designed for early malice detection in cryptocurrency. This system innovatively incorporates Asset Transfer Paths and corresponding path graphs in an evolve model, which effectively characterize rapidly evolving transaction patterns. First, for the target address, the Clustering-based Path Selector weight each Asset Transfer Path by finding sibling addresses along the Asset Transfer Paths. Evolve Path Encoder LSTM and Evolve Path Graph GCN then encode the asset transfer path and path graph within a dynamic structure. Additionally, our Hierarchical Survival Predictor efficiently scales to predict the address labels, demonstrating high scalability and efficiency. We rigorously tested Evolve Path Tracer on three real-world datasets of malicious addresses, where it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods. Our extensive scalability tests further confirmed the model's robust adaptability in dynamic prediction environments, highlighting its potential as a significant tool in the realm of cryptocurrency security.

The attack started through e-mails and has expanded through spamming and phishing. Ransomware encrypts targets' files and display notifications, requesting for payment before the data can be unlocked. Ransom demand is usually in form of virtual currency, bitcoin, because it is difficult to track. In this paper, we give a brief overview of the current trend, challenges, and research progress in the bid to finding lasting solutions to the menace of ransomware that currently challenge computer and network security, and data privacy.

With the increasing popularity of smart contracts, blockchain systems, in particular Ethereum, have been the "paradise" of versatile fraud activities. In this work, we present SCSGuard, a novel deep learning scam detection framework that harnesses the automatically extractable bytecodes of smart contracts as their new features. We design a GRU network with attention mechanism learning from the N-gram bytecode patterns to determine whether a smart contract is fraudulent or not. Our framework is advantageous over the baseline algorithms in three aspects. Firstly, SCSGuard provides a unified solution to different scam genres, thus relieving the need for code analysis skills. Secondly, the inference of SCSGuard is faster than the code analysis by several orders of magnitudes. Thirdly, experimental results manifest that SCSGuard achieves high accuracy (0.92 similar to 0.94), precision (0.94 similar to 0.96) and recall (0.97 similar to 0.98) for both Ponzi and Honeypot scams under similar settings, and is potentially useful to detect new Phishing smart contracts.

The proposed framework empowers entities that are responsible for a sub-network to collaboratively construct an FDIA detection model, effectively addressing issues associated with data sharing and enabling the utilization of various measurements from each sub-network. The proposed framework enables real-time collaboration between the server and the grid edge-side by allocating the two models created through the split learning approach applied to the proposed attention-based hybrid deep learning model. The grid edge-side is tasked with extracting spatial features, while the server is responsible for extracting temporal features from the data processed by the grid edge-side. The edge-side model is designed by adopting an attention module integrated into a deep learning model while the server-side model is designed based on the Bi-LSTM model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the IEEE 123 and IEEE 37 node test systems.

Malicious URLs have been widely used to mount various cyber-attacks like spear phishing, pharming, phishing and malware. By falsely claiming to be a trustworthy entity, users are lured into clicking on these compromised links to divulge vital information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details and unknowingly succumb to identity theft. Hence, the detection of malicious URLs in e-mails is very essential so as to help internet users implement safe practices and as well prevent them from becoming victims of fraud. This paper explores how malicious links in e-mails can be detected from the lexical and host-based features of their URLs to protect users from identity theft attacks. This research uses Naive Bayesian classifier as a probabilistic model to detect if a URL is malicious or legitimate. The Naive Bayesian classifier is used to count up the occurrence of each feature in an e-mail and calculate the cumulative score. If the cumulative score is greater than the given threshold, the URL is considered malicious otherwise the URL is legitimate.

Buffer overflow has become the most serious security threat of smart grid. The embedded network security equipment needs more ability to resist buffer overflow attack. Based on the bask principle of buffer overflow, a multi-level anti-buffer mechanism is put forward and applied to embedded security devices in this paper, which can fundamentally curb the occurrence of buffer overflow and maintain a good network transmission environment for smart grid.

However, it is unclear if adversarial examples represent realistic inputs in the modeled domains. Diverse domains such as networks and phishing have domain constraints-complex relationships between features that an adversary must satisfy for an attack to be realized (in addition to any adversary-specific goals). In this paper, we explore how domain constraints limit adversarial capabilities and how adversaries can adapt their strategies to create realistic (constraint-compliant) examples. In this, we develop techniques to learn domain constraints from data, and show how the learned constraints can be integrated into the adversarial crafting process. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in network intrusion and phishing datasets and find: (1) up to 82% of adversarial examples produced by state-of-the-art crafting algorithms violate domain constraints, (2) domain constraints are robust to adversarial examples; enforcing constraints yields an increase in model accuracy by up to 34%. We observe not only that adversaries must alter inputs to satisfy domain constraints, but that these constraints make the generation of valid adversarial examples far more challenging.

While previous works mostly focused on predicting attacks as seen from a single observation point, we proposed taking advantage of collaboration and exchange of intrusion detection alerts among organizations and networks. Thus, we can observe the cyber attack on a large scale and predict the next action of an adversary and its target. The thesis follows the three levels of cyber situational awareness: perception, comprehension, and projection. In the perception phase, we discuss the improvements of intrusion detection systems that allow for sharing intrusion detection alerts and their correlation. In the comprehension phase, we employed data mining to discover frequent attack patterns. In the projection phase, we present the analytical framework for the predictive analysis of the alerts backed by data mining and contemporary data processing approaches. The results are shown from experimental evaluation in the security alert sharing platform SABU, where real-world alerts from Czech academic and commercial networks are shared. The thesis is accompanied by the implementation of the analytical framework and a dataset that provides a baseline for future work.

Whenever load perturbation takes place in the network, frequency diverges from its nominal value and unplanned exchange of power leads to unfortunate consequences. This will cause the mal-operation of electrical equipment such as change in speed, low efficiency, vibrations, harmonics, inaccuracy etc. Automatic Generation Control (AGC) provides a signal to alter the actual output power of multiple generators within a certain range based on changes in system frequency. For this purpose, several control techniques were employed in the system. This paper focuses on various approaches in the domain of automatic generation control for microgrid based hybrid power system. AI based techniques shows progressive results as compared to other classical and cascaded approaches. Machine learning and deep learning based controlling schemes has also been studied and study shows that these techniques provides loftier performance in comparison of other AI methods due to the availability of large number of trained data sets of controlled variable. Further massive data of controlled variables can be used to restore the system after cyber-attack. It is also addressed how to integrate electric vehicles with the power grid for Load Frequency Control. At the end of this article, some research gap such as role of demand response, protection and control issues, resilient controllers for cyber threats etc. are also addressed which will be useful for researcher working in this area.

Thus, interactions among the relevant actors should be considered to model the impacts of cyber-attacks on EV charging prices. In response, this article copes with this issue through a novel two-step framework which is reinforced by employing a machine learning (ML)-based attack detector. In the first step, the interactions between the cyber attackers and EV management center (EVMC) are modeled as a bilevel optimization problem. In this modeling, the perspectives of both attackers and EVMC are considered. In addition, a new method using ML is developed to detect the cyber attacks aiming at manipulating EV charging prices. For this purpose, a self-generated dataset is created by modifying the EV charging price in the California state. This dataset is supplied into the developed ML algorithm, to analyze and detect any malicious data instantly. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithms are exploited in this work to improve the detection accuracy to 98%. In the second step, an optimization method is used to address the distribution system operator's (DSO's) concerns by power grid reconfiguration to minimize the grid's power losses during the intervention. The IEEE-123 bus distribution system is employed to verify the performance of the proposed framework. The results have confirmed the effectiveness and the high performance of the proposed method. Application of this method resulted in considerable reduction in the financial losses of attacked EV charging stations.

J	Pateriya, RK; Verma, P; Singh, D				Pateriya, Rajesh Kumar; Verma, Priyanka; Singh, Dharam			MAD-SE: ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD-BASED STACK ENSEMBLE APPROACH FOR THE DETECTION OF DDOS ATTACK IN CLOUD	SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cloud computing; Dynamic threshold; DDoS attack; Ensemble learning; Machine learning	ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; INTRUSION DETECTION; COMPUTING ISSUES; SECURITY	At present, cyber-attacks are steadily increasing in the cloud network. TCP, ICMP, UDP protocol-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are the major contributors for making the cloud-based system unsafe. The rate of growth of DDoS cyber-attack is a severe and challenging problem in the network. In the literature, to handle such attacks, various feature selection, and classification techniques are used. In these methods, for the collection of optimal attributes, static thresholding methods are applied. However, when the various variant of DDoS causes a DDoS attack, the size of packets and attribute's value is significantly changed. Thus, the methods utilizing static statistics are not suitable for a dynamic network. Therefore, an adaptive threshold-based Mean Absolute Deviation technique (MAD) is used to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, in this work, the Stacked Ensemble (SE) approach is utilized instead of the single classification algorithm for the classification purpose. The proposed approach comprises of three components; (1) data pre-processing, (2) optimal attribute selection, and (3) detection and prevention system from DDoS attacks. In this work, to evaluate the proposed approach, a standard NSL-KDD dataset is used. It is observed that MAD with SE beats all other combinations. In conventional methods, selecting a single classifier may not perform well because it works well on training data, but it poorly classifies the non-viewed new data. The stack ensemble approach removes this issue. Moreover TCP, UDP, and ICMP-based DDoS flooding attacks can also be easily noticed and classified by MAD -SE.

In this study, we attempt to build a framework that utilizes unconventional signals from the darkweb forums by leveraging the reply network structure of user interactions with the goal of predicting enterprise-related external cyber attacks. We use both unsupervised and supervised learning models that address the challenges that come with the lack of enterprise attack metadata for ground-truth validation as well as insufficient data for training the models. We validate our models on a binary classification problem that attempts to predict cyber attacks on a daily basis for an organization. Using several controlled studies on features leveraging the network structure, we measure the extent to which the indicators from the darkweb forums can be successfully used to predict attacks. We use information from 53 forums in the darkweb over a span of 17 months for the task. Our framework to predict real-world organization cyber attacks of three different security events suggests that focusing on the reply path structure between groups of users based on random walk transitions and community structures has an advantage in terms of better performance solely relying on forum or user posting statistics prior to attacks.

J	Kravchik, M; Demetrio, L; Biggio, B; Shabtai, A				Kravchik, Moshe; Demetrio, Luca; Biggio, Battista; Shabtai, Asaf			Practical Evaluation of Poisoning Attacks on Online Anomaly Detectors in Industrial Control Systems	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Anomaly detection; Industrial control systems; Autoencoders; Adversarial machine learning; Poisoning attacks; Adversarial robustness	SECURITY	Recently, neural networks (NNs) have been proposed for the detection of cyber attacks targeting indus-trial control systems (ICSs). Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system oper-ation, to cope with the evolution of the monitored signals over time. However, by exploiting this mech-anism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector to allow cyber attacks to stay undetected at test time. Previous work ex-plored the ability to generate adversarial samples that fool anomaly detection models in ICSs but without compromising their training process. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online detectors based on neural networks. We propose two distinct attack al-gorithms, namely, interpolation-and back-gradient-based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness. The evaluation is conducted on diverse data sources: synthetic data, real-world ICS testbed data, and a simulation of the Tennessee Eastman process. This first practical evaluation of poisoning attacks using a simulation tool highlights the challenges of poisoning dynamically controlled systems.

Advancement of Human Driven Edge Computing (HEC) with 5(th) Generation Internet services also makes this more feasible. Use of IoT and increased demand of BYOD becomes one of the fundamental needs to increase the organization employee productivity and business agility. But it increased the significant risk of the cyber-attack which is leading a major reason for business disruption and becomes a leading question about how to get a cyber secured citizenship in the smart city environment as well as in the organization where BYOD is used in large numbers. In order to conduct forensic investigation post incident detection of malicious activities from IoT/BYOD end point is most challenging task. A strategic practical approach in this research is presented to detect malicious activities so that organization can adopt to protect the critical infrastructure and smart city critical infrastructure. In order to achieve the goal of detecting of malicious activities in BYOD environment, simulation performed in 3 phases. The 1(st) phase of the simulation performed while BYOD endpoint was outside the organization over the internet without VPN. The 2(nd) phase of the simulation was performed where BYOD endpoint was securely onboarded using a corporate wireless network with a secured onboarding process. The 3(rd) phase of the test done where IoT/BYOD was outside the organization with a VPN. A unique robust scalable model puts forward with significant result from this research and concluded for creating a cyber forensic ecosystem in IoT/BYOD environment to enable cyber secured citizenship in era of HEC with 5G and IoT.

At the same time, customers' expectations for the service quality are keeping the pressure on operators. It requires huge human efforts to maintain a sustainable and high-performance radio access network. To meet the highest quality and service level requirements, more and more network management and maintenance functions are required to be passed to automated solutions. There are many already like SON, MLB, automatic antenna tilting which helps to scale operations. Those are dedicated to improving specific functions, but they do not pay much attention to service KPIs, which are a direct reflection of customers' experience. Most often, changes in network performance KPIs indicate some interruption or deterioration of service quality, which needs to be restored as soon as possible. Automated solutions based on machine learning process enables engineers to notice those network issues much faster. There are many algorithms that have been created for this purpose, but most of them are specialized and tuned to detect an anomaly in the special datasets, like fraud, abnormal CPU usage, earthquake, cyber-attack. Consequently, it is either not applicable or not performing well while identifying anomalies on telecommunication network performance data. The research on this paper proofs anomaly detection accuracy problem, lack of functions for telecommunication data in existing R libraries. The only R "changepoint" package has a functionality to detect not a single local anomaly, but also anomalous time series, which is the most relevant in RAN (radio access network) performance monitoring. Default function meanvar() of method - PELT, penalty - BIC returns up to 30 false positive anomalies in retainability and integrity KPI and up to 10 in mobility KPI group on one month time series data. To extract true positive anomalies additional algorithm is applied with a cost of false negative detection increase up to 10% in a single time series data and occurs not more than in 5% of used datasets. These results are compared against other popular R libraries, like "Anomalize", "AnomalyDetection", "bcp", "changepoint" and proofed to be the most accurate on radio network performance data. This adapted anomaly detection algorithm can be treated as a scalable generic algorithm to any kind of high-dimensionality data as it does not require additional tuning for different KPI group or technology. It is the solution for automated network performance monitoring that can take off a lot of workload from daily network engineer routine and improve the quality while tackling network performance issues.

Commissioning Random Matrix Theory and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Power System Faults Detection and Classification	NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, ICONIP 2022, PT VII	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	29th International Conference on Neural Information Processing	NOV 22-26, 2022	Indore, INDIA			Decision tree; Power system fault; Fault Data; Line Fault classification	DATA INJECTION ATTACKS	The fast paced innovation in communication and computation capabilities has laid the foundation of sophisticated transformation from legacy power systems to smart grid (SG) infrastructure. So, Providing the effective protection to the distribution lines against the power system faults is crucial for smart grid stability, however it totally depends upon the accurate detection and classification of line fault category. In recent years, Data driven perspective evolved on machine learning classification models are in practice for cyber attack detection. Though the classification accuracy suffers since contingency or anomalous data transcends rarely than normal data in the power flow analysis. This paper presents a complete approach starting from the contingency data generation using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and ending with the power fault detection and classification. The proposed method uses power flow analysis of the current signals and applied Objective cost sensitive support vector machine (OCSSVM) for the detection and applies decision tree for the correct faults classification in the smart grid infrastructure. Faults investigated in the paper include line to ground (LG) fault, double line (LL) fault, three phase fault with ground (LLLG) and double line to ground (LLG) fault. To support the effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to IEEE-9 and IEEE-14 node test feeder. Finally, we juxtapose the results in terms of accuracy with the state of the art models and established the efficacy of proposed method.	[Sinha, Ayush; Vyas, O.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and mitigation: A survey	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						XSS; Cookies; DOM-XSS	DEFENSE; VULNERABILITIES; FRAMEWORK; INJECTION	The results of the Cisco 2018 Annual Security Report show that all analyzed web applications have at least one vulnerability. It also shows that web attacks are becoming more frequent, specific and sophisticated. According to this report, 40% of all attack attempts lead to a method known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which was the most widely used technique. According to the OWASP Top 10 - 2017 security risk, this type of attack is ranked No. 7, and it is noted that XSS is present in approximately two thirds of all web applications. This attack occurs when a malicious user uses a web application to execute or send malicious code on another user's computer. Also, Cross Site Scripting is a type of cyber attack by which vulnerabilities are searched in a web application to introduce a harmful script. This implies that user information can be affected by stealing cookies, phishing, or attacking a company's entire network. In this context, we have analyzed a total of 67 documents to collect information of the tools and methods that the scientific community has used to detect and mitigate these type of attack. It has been hypothesized that the trend in the proposal of traditional methods to mitigate XSS attacks is greater than the proposals that use some artificial intelligence technique. Our results show that the trend is increasing in the proposals that analyze the content of web pages (13.20%), as well as those that serve as a toolkit for web browsers (16.98%). Also, we have found that there is a low tendency in the use of artificial intelligence techniques to detect or mitigate this attack, using Web Classifiers (9.43%). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Social engineers rely on people's ignorance of the consequence of sharing their valuable information, as well as their lack of knowledge for securing their systems and IT infrastructure from security attacks. These attacks may be carried out by the employees of an organization, through a third-party agency. They violate the rules of the organization for financial gain or revenge. The attacker uses different tactics to gather sensitive information of the victims, this itself is a method of social engineering attack. The process of gaining confidential information illegally is a criminal act. The proposed research study has developed a framework to find the message received from an unknown source or URL is a spam or legitimate by using natural language process (NLP). During COVID-19, many peoples started using Internet for their daily activities without the knowledge of security risks in Internet. This rise in the number of individuals using the Internet is virtually never accompanied by knowledge about cyber security and other forms of Internet based attacks. This attracted the attackers to target these victims and launch their attacks. SEA is a form of advanced cyber security attack, which use people's natural curiosity to break surveillance systems and have a high success rate. The goal of the study is to look at the details of how the COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for an expansion of social engineering attacks, as well as various methods for detecting and mitigating these attacks.

Goodness of fuzzy association rules is measured by a fitness function viz., the product of support and confidence. So as to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we implemented it to phishing detection domain. Based on the goodness of the rules obtained, we infer that our proposed algorithm can be used as a sound alternative to the fuzzy apriori algorithm.

Lakshmana			Analysis on homomorphic technique for data security in fog computing	TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							SCHEME; CLOUD	The fog computing model has given new trends of networking with different types of devices providing services at the end-user point. It inherits most advanced features of cloud computing with localization rather than centralization like a cloud. It builds a platform for the Internet of things of different standards. Similar to the cloud, it is prone to privacy and security threat while sharing resources and services at the network edge. When the request for support is with more sensitive data, for example, as in business or research area, then fog devices face many potential threats resulting in leakage of data. The existing cloud environment provides data sharing service to the legal requestor in a highly secured manner using cryptographic encryption techniques. The uploaded data undergoes encryption and decryption, at the sending and receiving end only on providing the private key. Even more, security can be achieved by further computation on encrypted data. As an extension to fog computing, the data communication between fog nodes-fog nodes and fog node-cloud center is done with encryption/decryption for ensuring confidentiality. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique which allows performing computations on encrypted data without decryption so that the original message need not be disclosed to intermediates (servers) who are the only service provider and not a data user. Our work is motivated by the flaw of security issues in fog computing platforms, which involve heterogeneous devices.

J	Alamer, A				Alamer, Abdulrahman			A privacy-preserving federated learning with a secure collaborative for malware detection models using Internet of Things resources	INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						Malware; Privacy-preserving; Federated Learning; Incentive; IoT devices		The rise in malware attacks presents a growing security threat in today's digital landscape, emphasizing the need for advanced malware detection methodology. While numerous detection systems utilizing methodologies like machine learning (ML) have been developed, they often fail to detect new and unknown malware in real time. This is because their malware datasets are generated with a very limited source and are not dynamic for up-to-date malware. Thus, with of the growth of the Internet of Things, malware have also increasingly grown, which makes current malware detection systems outdated in a short time. Therefore, IoT device resources can be exploited for building malware datasets having various types of malware families. In addition, the approach of collecting data from IoT devices and training them in a centralized cloud (CC) server is no longer acceptable due to this approach incurs significant security and privacy issues. This paper proposes PPFL-SC, an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning with a secure collaborative supporting verification. A group-oblivious signcryption cryptography is designed to be used as a privacy-preserving technique for federated learning. The CC server aggregates data without compromising individual data privacy. Moreover, the Stackelberg incentive model is designed as an incentive mechanism for encouraging IoT devices to collaborate through their heterogeneous dataset in a malware detection model. Thus, the proposed incentive mechanism is capable of increasing the participation of IoT devices and decreasing their dropping out during model updating. A security analysis confirms that PPFL-SC fulfills all security requirements for privacy-preserving federated learning. Real-world dataset experiments validate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed PPFL-SC.

Current methods for malware analysis achieves promising results using linear methods, such as, PCA. It is well-known that the underlying physical processes behind malware binaries to image conversion are highly nonlinear. Our work set out to understand the impact of malware image resolution on suitable neighborhood size over which to consider pattern phenomena, if nonlinear methods capture pattern phenomena with increased efficacy, and how they improve clustering and identification of malware. In real-life use cases, good clustering practice requires scientific and domain knowledge. As there is no rich domain history of malware image data, we set out to explore different clustering methods with reasoning. Image domains are typically high-dimensional and can have many instantiations. For this reason, statistical approaches to clustering can fail because low probability mass is associated with a single image. Moreover, related images will therefore have subtle differences as measured by their probabilities. We developed an information theoretic method for measurement of malware image resolutions and found that nonlinear methods are better in capturing underlying data regularity and give statistically significant improvement in clustering results than linear methods. This is the first application of nonlinear Manifold learning to malware image analysis in the research literature.

However, because of its high-speed mobility, wireless connectivity, and extensive node coverage, security is a more difficult procedure. The Sybil security threat on VANET is a growing problem today. The Road Side Unit (RSU) failed to synchronise its clock with the legal vehicle, then unplanned vehicles are predicted, thereby incorrect messages are transferred to them. In this paper, Competitive Dolphin Echolocation Optimisation (CDEO)-based Deep Residual Network is proposed for Sybil attack and RSU misbehaviour detection. Here, the effective routing process is performed using Fractional Glow-Worm Swarm Optimisation (FGWSO)-based traffic-aware routing protocol. In the base station, the Sybil attack detection is done. The Sybil attack detection process is done using a Deep residual network, which is trained by the proposed CDEO algorithm. The CDEO algorithm is devised by incorporating Dolphin Echolocation Optimisation (DEO) technique and Competitive Swarm Optimiser (CSO). Additionally, using the Deep residual network, the RSU misbehaviour detection is done. The performance of the developed method is compared with certain performance metrics, like precision, F1-measure, and recall of 0.9197, 0.9121, and 0.9046.

Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors. In this paper, we design a novel detection model with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) based data augmentation and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)based data cleaning technique to reconstruct the imbalanced training dataset into a balanced one to train the subsequent XGBoost classifier. Experiments show that although rare anomalous historical event records are needed, our model is still able to effectively detect out DMAs in power systems.

This observation motivates the design and deployment of automated approaches to support investigators in preventing or effectively mitigating security threats. However, building a domain name classification system suitable for deployment in an operational environment requires meticulous design: from feature engineering and acquiring the underlying data to handling missing values resulting from, for example, data collection errors. The design flaws in some of the existing systems make them unsuitable for such usage despite their high theoretical accuracy. Even worse, they may lead to erroneous decisions, for example, by registrars, such as suspending a benign domain name that has been compromised at the website level, causing collateral damage to the legitimate registrant and website visitors. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to designing domain name classifiers that overcome the shortcomings of some existing systems. We validate these approaches with a prototype based on the COMAR (COmpromised versus MAliciously Registered domains) system focusing on its careful design, automated and reliable ground truth generation, feature selection, and the analysis of the extent of missing values. First, our classifier takes advantage of automatically generated ground truth based on publicly available domain name registration data. We then generate a large number of machine-learning models, each dedicated to handling a set of missing features: if we need to classify a domain name with a given set of missing values, we use the model without the missing feature set, thus allowing classification based on all other features. We estimate the importance of features using scatter plots and analyze the extent of missing values due to measurement errors. Finally, we apply the COMAR classifier to unlabeled phishing URLs and find, among other things, that 73% of corresponding domain names are maliciously registered. In comparison, only 27% are benign domains hostingmalicious websites. The proposed system has been deployed at two ccTLD registry operators to support their anti-fraud practices.

J	Cheng, X; Chen, FL; Xie, D; Sun, H; Huang, C				Cheng, Xu; Chen, Fulong; Xie, Dong; Sun, Hui; Huang, Cheng			Design of a Secure Medical Data Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Medical cyber physical systems; Data security sharing; Blockchain; Decentralization feature; Security authentication	AUTHENTICATION	With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data, Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) are increasingly demanding data security, while cloud storage solves the storage problem of complex medical data. However, it is difficult to realize data security sharing. The decentralization feature of blockchain is helpful to solve the problem that the secure authentication process is highly dependent on the trusted third party and implement data security transmission. In this paper, the blockchain technology is used to describe the security requirements in authentication process, and a network model of MCPS based on blockchain is proposed. Through analysis of medical data storage architecture, it can ensure that data can't be tampered and untrackable. In the security authentication phase, bilinear mapping and intractable problems can be used to solve the security threat in the authentication process of medical data providers and users. It can avoid the credibility problem of the trusted third party, and also can realize the ?thyc=10?>two-way authentication between the hospital and blockchain node. Then, BAN logic is used to analyze security protocols, and formal analysis and comparison of security protocols are also made. The results show that the MCPS based on blockchain not only realizes medical treatment data sharing, but also meet the various security requirements in the security authentication phase. In addition, the storage and computing overhead costs is ideal. Therefore, the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure sharing of medical big data.

J	Ilyasa, SN; Khadidos, AO				Ilyasa, Sinar Nadhif; Khadidos, Alaa Omar			Optimized SMS Spam Detection Using SVM-DistilBERT and Voting Classifier: A Comparative Study on the Impact of Lemmatization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						SMS spam detection; Support Vector Machine (SVM); DistilBERT; hyperparameter optimization; LIME		The rapid growth of digital communication has led to a surge in spam messages, particularly through Short Message Service (SMS). These unsolicited messages pose risks such as phishing and malware, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study focuses on a comparative analysis of machine learning models for SMS spam detection, with a particular emphasis on a proposed SVM-DistilBERT model enhanced by a voting classifier. Using the UCI SMS Spam dataset, the models are evaluated based on recall, accuracy, precision, and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) scores to assess their effectiveness in correctly identifying spam messages. By leveraging Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, the proposed model achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 99.6%, surpassing traditional methods like SVM with TF-IDF Bi-gram and AdaBoost, which achieved 98.03%. The study also examines the effects of lemmatization and synonym data augmentation, with lemmatization shown to improve spam detection by reducing feature space redundancy and enhancing semantic understanding. To ensure transparency in decision-making, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is applied. The results demonstrate that the optimized SVM-DistilBERT with the voting classifier offers a robust and effective solution for SMS spam filtering.

By decoupling control and data plane, SDN can provide various defense solutions for securing futuristic networks. However, the architectural design and characteristics of SDN attract several severe attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is considered as a major destructive cyber attack that makes the services of controller unavailable for its legitimate users. In this research article, an intrusion detection framework is proposed to detect DDoS attacks against SDN. The proposed framework relies on voting-based ensemble model for the attack detection. Ensemble model is a combination of multiple machine learning classifiers for prediction of final results. In this research article, we propose and analyze three ensemble models named as Voting-CMN, Voting-RKM, and Voting-CKM particularly to benchmarking datasets such as UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, and NSL-KDD, respectively. For validation of the proposed models, a cross-validation technique is used with the prediction algorithms. The effectiveness of proposed models is evaluated in terms of prominent metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure). Experimental results indicate that the proposed models achieve better performance in terms of accuracy as compared with other existing models.

Based on the client demands, requirements, and specifications, manufacturing company is sending physical items or layouts or STL files to destinations which can be local and international places. Unfortunately, it is a challenging, expensive, risky, and time consuming task. Interesting, the internet of things (IoT) can play an important role to transfer design layout to the qualified and intended destination for verification and fabrication. Regrettably, attacker can hack, modify, steal, and destroy layout and prototype over networks. Due to industrial revolution, the additive manufacturing industry is the second most vulnerable sector after financial institution where cyber attack can play significant impact. This paper summarises the cyber physical additive manufacturing systems security and privacy issues and provide a secure IoT communication architecture. In order to improve the security and privacy, we proposed an innovative IoT communication network where information is securely transferred to the destination.

Despite great success in traditional attacks, most deep-learning-based methods perform poorly in 3D masks, which can highly simulate real faces in appearance and structure, suffering generalizability insufficiency while focusing only on the spatial domain with single frame input. This has been mitigated by the recent introduction of a biomedical technology called rPPG (remote photoplethysmography). However, rPPG-based methods are sensitive to noisy interference and require at least one second (> 25 frames) of observation time, which induces high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D mask detection framework, called FASTEN (Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal aggrEgation Network). We tailor the network for focusing more on fine-grained details in large movements, which can eliminate redundant spatio-temporal feature interference and quickly capture splicing traces of 3D masks in fewer frames. Our proposed network contains three key modules: 1) a facial optical flow network to obtain non-RGB inter-frame flow information; 2) flow attention to assign different significance to each frame; 3) spatio-temporal aggregation to aggregate high-level spatial features and temporal transition features. Through extensive experiments, FASTEN only requires five frames of input and outperforms eight competitors for both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations in terms of multiple detection metrics. Moreover, FASTEN has been deployed in real-world mobile devices for practical 3D mask detection.

These examples' transferability makes an attack in the real-world feasible, which poses a security threat to deep learning. Considering the limited representation capacity of a single deep model, the transferability of an adversarial example generated by a single attack model would cause the failure of attacking other different models. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial attack method, named EnsembleFool, which flexibly integrates multiple models to enhance adversarial examples' transferability. Specifically, the model confidence concerning an input example reveals the risk of a successful attack. In an iterative attacking case, the result of a previous attack could guide us to enforce a new attack that possesses a higher probability of success. Regarding this, we design a series of integration strategies to improve the adversarial examples in each iteration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet indicate that the proposed method has superior attack performance and transferability than state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, this complex amalgamation is challenging cybersecurity professionals to understand and analyse both the attack surfaces and attack vectors that threat actors could potentially exploit. Cybersecurity professionals have been driven to explore different attack models to understand and analyse various cyberattacks and their attack vectors. There are several attack models that have already been developed and are being used in the analysis of different cyberattacks and their mitigations. Each of these attack models has some specific characteristics, strengths and limitations. It is therefore crucial to study the use of the most common attack models for operational technologies in order to comprehend their effectiveness for analysing cyberattacks on OT systems. This paper will analyse the features, strengths, and limitations of three widely recognised attack models: Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK Framework and Diamond Model for OT systems. It conducts a comparative analysis of these three attack models to provide a complete evaluation of the most suitable model for OT systems.

Through these functionalities, Smartphone owner can exchange information to each other by sharing links or even files. However, an attacker see these as an advantage to perform an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT is an attack which incorporates both social engineering attack and malware. In this paper, the authors will shed light on how APT attack through spear phishing can occur in Smartphone and how to detect it. First, the authors will examine the tactics that can be used by the attacker to perform a successful social engineering attack. Then, based on the discussion that has been made, the authors have used a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a certain URL is a phish or not. Lastly, the authors have evaluated the propose technique using machine learning and obtained more than 90% accuracy. This proves, that the proposed technique would able to help mitigating APT attack through spear phishing in the Smartphone. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As such, attackers often create similar-looking UIs to deceive users, causing various security problems, such as spoofing and phishing. Prior studies identify these similar UIs based on their layout trees or screenshot images. These techniques, however, are susceptible to being evaded. Guided by how users perceive UIs and the features they prioritize, we design a novel grid-based UI representation to capture UI visual appearance while maintaining robustness against evasion. We develop an approach, UIHASH, to detect similar Android UIs by comparing their visual appearance. It divides the UI into a #-shaped grid and abstracts UI controls across screen regions, then calculates UI similarity through a neural network architecture that includes a convolutional neural network and a Siamese network. Our evaluation shows that UIHASH achieves an F1-score of 0.984 in detection, outperforming existing tree-based methods and image-based methods. Moreover, we have discovered evasion techniques that circumvent existing detection approaches.

Ransomware carries out an irreversible process, where it encrypts victims' digital assets to seek financial compensations. Adversaries utilize different means to gain initial access to the target machines, such as phishing emails, vulnerable public-facing software, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), brute-force attacks, and stolen accounts. To combat these threats of ransomware, this paper aims to help researchers gain a better understanding of ransomware application profiles through static analysis, where we identify a list of suspicious indicators and similarities among 727 active ransomware samples. We start with generating portable executable (PE) metadata for all the studied samples. With our domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis tasks, we introduce some of the suspicious indicators of the structure of ransomware files. We reduce the dimensionality of the generated dataset by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and discover clusters by applying the KMeans algorithm. This motivates us to utilize the one-class classification algorithms on the generated dataset. As a result, the algorithms learn the common data boundary in the structure of our studied ransomware samples, and thereby, we achieve the data-driven similarities. We use the findings to evaluate the trained classifiers with the test samples and observe that the Local Outlier Factor (LoF) performs better on all the selected feature spaces compared to the One-Class SVM and the Isolation Forest algorithms.

Proxies are widely used in the current network environment. However, certain spy proxies record user information for privacy theft. In addition, attackers can use such technologies to anonymize malicious behaviors and hide identities. Such behaviors have posed serious challenges to the internal defense and security threat assessment of an organization; however, the anonymity of the proxy makes it consistent with normal network communication, and general network traffic identification methods are not able to detect it. To accurately and effectively discover proxy users in the organization based on s, a proxy user detection method based on communication behavior portrait offers the following: (1) analysis of the communication behavior from the perspective of the portrait. Based on not abandoning the effective information of the traffic itself, the label system is established by introducing exogenous data to identify the difference between proxy communication and normal communication. (2) Construction of the portrait feature set of proxy user detection based on the traffic file and external data by studying the differences between the attribute sets of communication behavior labels for proxy users and non-proxy users. (3) Design and implementation a data-driven machine learning method to supply guidance for automatic recognition of such behavior. The experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy for the proxy user exceeds 95%, and that of real network traffic environment exceeds 85%. These results indicate that the detection method proposed in this paper can accurately distinguish proxy communication and normal communication and thus achieves precise proxy user detection.

J	Alazab, M; Khurma, RA; Camacho, D; Martin, A				Alazab, Moutaz; Khurma, Ruba Abu; Camacho, David; Martin, Alejandro			Enhanced Android Ransomware Detection Through Hybrid Simultaneous Swarm-Based Optimization	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Malware; Ransomware; Optimzation; Simulated annealing; SMOTE; Feature selection		Ransomware is a significant security threat that poses a serious risk to the security of smartphones, and its impact on portable devices has been extensively discussed in a number of research papers. In recent times, this threat has witnessed a significant increase, causing substantial losses for both individuals and organizations. The emergence and widespread occurrence of diverse forms of ransomware present a significant impediment to the pursuit of reliable security measures that can effectively combat them. This constitutes a formidable challenge due to the dynamic nature of ransomware, which renders traditional security protocols inadequate, as they might have a high false alarm rate and exert significant processing demands on mobile devices that are restricted by limited battery life, CPU, and memory. This paper proposes a novel intelligent method for detecting ransomware that is based on a hybrid multi-solution binary JAYA algorithm with a single-solution simulated annealing (SA). The primary objective is to leverage the exploitation power of SA in supporting the exploration power of the binary JAYA algorithm. This approach results in a better balance between global and local search milestones. The empirical results of our research demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SMO-BJAYA-SA-SVM method over other algorithms based on the evaluation measures used. The proposed method achieved an accuracy rate of 98.7%, a precision of 98.6%, a recall of 98.7%, and an F1 score of 98.6%.

These sophisticated threats can exploit Internet of Things (IoT) devices to undertake an array of cyberattacks, ranging from basic infections to complex operations, such as phishing, cryptojacking, and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Existing machine learning solutions are often constrained by their limited generalizability across various data sets and their inability to adapt to the mutable patterns of malware attacks in real world environments, a challenge known as model drift. This limitation highlights the pressing need for adaptive intrusion detection systems (IDSs), capable of adjusting to evolving threat patterns and new or unseen attacks. This article introduces MalBoT-DRL, a robust malware botnet detector using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Designed to detect botnets throughout their entire lifecycle, MalBoT-DRL has better generalizability and offers a resilient solution to model drift. This model integrates damped incremental statistics with an attention reward mechanism, a combination that has not been extensively explored in the literature. This integration enables MalBoT-DRL to dynamically adapt to the ever-changing malware patterns within IoT environments. The performance of MalBoT-DRL has been validated via trace-driven experiments using two representative data sets: 1) MedBIoT and 2) N-BaIoT, resulting in exceptional average detection rates of 99.80% and 99.40% in the early and late detection phases, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work introduces one of the first studies to investigate the efficacy of RL in enhancing the generalizability of IDS.

A novel event-triggered scheme based on switching between periodic sampling and a continuous event-triggered scheme was proposed, which not only cuts down the number of data transmissions but also offsets cyberattacks. By choosing a suitable piecewise LyapunovKrasovskii functional and using several free-weighting matrices, sufficient conditions were established to ensure the exponential stability of the synchronization error system in the occurrence of DoS attacks. Furthermore, a co-design method was provided to acquire the desired non-fragile output-feedback control gain and event-triggering parameter. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Criminals can use some technologies such as Trojan or Phishing to steal the information of other people's credit cards. Therefore, an effictive fraud detection method is important since it can identify a fraud in time when a criminal uses a stolen card to consume. One method is to make full use of the historical transaction data including normal transactions and fraud ones to obtain normal/fraud behavior features based on machine learning techniques, and then utilize these features to check if a transaction is fraud or not. In this paper, two kinds of random forests are used to train the behavior features of normal and abnormal transactions. We make a comparison of the two random forests which are different in their base classifiers, and analyze their performance on credit fraud detection. The data used in our experiments come from an e-commerce company in China.

This paper presents the second phase of the research in providing a network management system capable of delivering end-to-end QoS guarantees for Internet of Things (IOT) networks. The first phase of this work used a wireless test bed to develop a propagation model to incorporate the attenuation due to foliage in dense vegetation typically found in PA environments. The output of this propagation model will influence the decision making process in the network management system. Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) operate under the umbrella of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) protocol to deliver multimedia applications such as voice, video and live streaming. To operate successfully these multi-media applications have high QoS requirements. To enable these QoS requirements to be fulfilled performance metrics such as throughput, end-to-end delay and limited packet loss must be guaranteed. This next phase of the work in developing the intelligent network management system presented in this paper uses an OPNET (TM) simulation package to implement a modified K-Means algorithm to detect the presence of multi-media traffic. Consequently a signal informs the network management system to adopt pre-configured settings via the Personal Area Network Co-ordinator (PANC). The resulting changes implement service differentiation by manipulating the MAC layer (size of the individual GTS timeslots and duty cycle) to deliver better throughput and end-to-end delay performance. OPNET (TM) simulation results show that the new algorithm facilitates better performance and meets QoS requirements suitable to multimedia applications. This paper focuses on the derivation and evaluation of the performance of the K-Means algorithm. The sensory nodes are power, memory and computationally restricted. These restrictions coupled with the heterogeneous structure of the wireless network make intelligent network management systems very important if the QoS requirements are to be fulfilled. Upon detection of multimedia traffic with high QoS demands usually triggered in the aftermath of an event of particular interest e.g. security threat etc., a management system must dynamically effect change of the network configuration settings to maintain such guarantees. As real-time applications require an urgent response, the dynamic change must occur during run time automatically. This research work is novel in that it combines the output from the development of the physical layer propagation model to inform a network management system to trigger service differentiation for multimedia traffic in a PA environment.

Audio deepfakes emerge as an attractive vector for targeting users that rely on audio accessibility, such as individuals who are blind or low vision. The critical reliance on speech both as a medium and an affordance puts this population at an undue risk of being deceived as they rely solely on themselves to detect whether a piece of audio is a deepfake or not. To better understand the nature of this risk considering the nuanced reliance on assistive technologies such as screen readers, we conducted a user study with n=16 blind and low vision individuals from the US. Our participants achieved an overall discernment accuracy of 59%, and clips identified as deep fakes were only actually deepfakes in 50.8% of the cases (precision). The participants that self-identified as "low vision" performed slightly better (accuracy of 61%, precision of 64%) compared to the ones that self-identified as "blind" (accuracy of 55%, precision of 56%). Our qualitative results show that the participants in the "blind" group mostly considered a combination of infliction, imperfections in the voice, and the intensity in the speech delivery as discernment factors. The participants in the "low vision" group mostly used the speaker's pitch, enunciation, emotion, and the fluency and articulation of the speaker as discernment cues.

J	Basic, F; Gaertner, M; Steger, C				Basic, Fikret; Gaertner, Martin; Steger, Christian			Secure and Trustworthy NFC-Based Sensor Readout for Battery Packs in Battery Management Systems	IEEE JOURNAL OF RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION			English	Article						Batteries; Security; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks; Communication system security; Radiofrequency identification; Throughput; Battery management system; security; sensor; wireless; near field communication; anti counterfeiting		Wireless battery management systems (BMSs) are increasingly being considered for modern applications. The ever-increasing complexity and production costs of BMS modules and wired connections resulted in a necessity for new ideas and approaches. Despite this growing trend, there is a lack of generic solutions focused on battery cells' sensor readout, where wireless communication allows for a more flexible and cost-efficient sensor installation in battery packs. Many wireless technologies, such as those that use the 2.4GHz frequency band, suffer from interference and other limitations. In this article, we present an alternative approach to communication in BMS that relies on the use of near field communication (NFC) technology for battery sensor readouts. As an answer to the rising concern over the counterfeited battery packs, we consider an authentication schema for battery pack validation. We further consider security measures for the processed and stored BMS status data. To show that a general BMS application can make use of our design, we implement a BMS demonstrator using the targeted components. We further test the demonstrator on the technical and functional level, by also performing evaluation on its performance, energy usage, and a security threat model.

With the growing popularity of such websites, we suspect that, these services are not only used by innocent users, but also, malware writers for testing the evasion capability of their malware samples. May this hypothesis be true, it not only provides interesting insight on Android malware development (AMD), but also provides opportunities for important security applications such as zero-day sample detection. In this work, we first validate this hypothesis with massive data; then design a system AMDHunter to hunt for AMDs on VirusTotal that reveals new threats for Android that has never been revealed before. This is the first systematic study of the malware development phenomenon on VirusTotal, and the first system to automatically detect such malware development cases. AMDHunter has been used in a leading security company for months. Our study is driven by the large amount of data on VirusTotal We analyzed 153 million submissions collected on VirusTotal during 102 days. Our system identifies 1,623 AMDs with 13,855 samples from 83 countries. We also performed case studies on 890 malware samples selected from the identified AMDs, which revealed lots of new threats, e.g., the development cases of fake system/banking phishing malware, new rooting exploits and etc.	[Huang, Heqing; Chari, Suresh] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Huang, Heqing; Zhu, Sencun; Liu, Peng] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zheng, Cong] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zeng, Junyuan] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Zhou, Wu] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Zhang, Ce] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland	International Business Machines (IBM); IBM USA; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Penn State Behrend; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; North Carolina State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich	Huang, HQ (corresponding author), IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.; Huang, HQ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.	hhuang@us.ibm.com; cong@gatech.edu; sxz16@psu.edu; pliu@psu.edu; schari@us.ibm.com; ce.zhang@inf.ethz.ch	Liu, Peng/A-4255-2013	Zhang, Ce/0000-0002-8105-7505	ARO [W911NF-13-1-0421, W911NF-15-1-0576]; NSF [CCF-1320605, SBE-1422215, CNS-1505664, CNS-1422594]; NIETP CAE Cybersecurity; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1422594] Funding Source: National Science Foundation	ARO; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIETP CAE Cybersecurity; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))	This work is supported by ARO W911NF-13-1-0421 (MUM), NSF CCF-1320605, NSF SBE-1422215, ARO W911NF-15-1-0576, NIETP CAE Cybersecurity Grant, NSF CNS-1505664, and NSF CNS-1422594.

A Novel Bio-inspired Hybrid Metaheuristic for Unsolicited Bulk Email Detection	COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - ICCS 2020, PT III	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Annual International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)	JUN 03-05, 2020	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS			Evolutionary computing; Feature selection; Internet security; Metaheuristics; Natural language processing; Phishing; Spam		With the recent influx of technology, Unsolicited Bulk Emails (UBEs) have become a potential problem, leaving computer users and organizations at the risk of brand, data, and financial loss. In this paper, we present a novel bio-inspired hybrid parallel optimization algorithm (Cuckoo-Firefly-GR), which combines Genetic Replacement (GR) of low fitness individuals with a hybrid of Cuckoo Search (CS) and Firefly (FA) optimizations. Cuckoo-Firefly-GR not only employs the random walk in CS, but also uses mechanisms in FA to generate and select fitter individuals. The content- and behavior-based features of emails used in the existing works, along with Doc2Vec features of the email body are employed to extract the syntactic and semantic information in the emails. By establishing an optimal balance between intensification and diversification, and reaching global optimization using two metaheuristics, we argue that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of UBE detection, by selecting the most discriminative feature subspace. This study presents significant observations from the extensive evaluations on UBE corpora of 3,844 emails, that underline the efficiency and superiority of our proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR over the base optimizations (Cuckoo-GR and Firefly-GR), dense autoencoders, recurrent neural autoencoders, and several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the instructive feature subset obtained using the proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR, when classified using a dense neural model, achieved an accuracy of 99%.

J	Silveira, MR; Cansian, AM; Kobayashi, HK				Silveira, Marcos Rogerio; Cansian, Adriano Mauro; Kobayashi, Hugo Koji			Semi-supervised approach for detecting malicious domains in TLDs in their first query	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						Machine learning; Domain name system; Passive DNS; Malicious domain; Semi-supervised machine learning		The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for the functioning of the Internet, and due to its importance, malicious users exploit this structure to register domains capable of spreading phishing and malware. This study presents a method to detect malicious domains recently registered in Top-Level Domains (TLDs) based on the first DNS query. The approach is semi-supervised, combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning. We use a combination of two supervised algorithms and clustering for analysis. The results of the models feed into a final classifier, providing a probability of maliciousness for the domain. For the training of supervised models, the data is balanced using a hybrid technique of undersampling and oversampling. The training of the unsupervised model focuses exclusively on malicious domains, creating distinct malicious clusters. The models are evaluated in a real environment and can be updated through a retraining module when necessary. The results indicate an AUC of 0.9620 (+/- 0.01) and an ACC of 0.91 during training, with notable metrics of ACC 0.88, TPR 0.884, TNR 0.875, FPR 0.124, and FNR 0.110 in the testing phase simulating production.

J	Qin, ZJ; Lai, Y				Qin, Zhijun; Lai, Yu			Detection and Localization of Coordinated State-and-Topology False Data Injection Attack by Multi-modal Learning	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Power system cyber security; False data injection attack; Topology attack; Multi-modal learning; Data-driven methods	POWER-SYSTEMS	False data injection attack (FDIA) is a typical cyber-attack targeting on power system state estimation. By inserting bias into the power system meter measurements, FDIA can cause errors in state estimation and consequently mislead power system operation. Recently, the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA was developed to falsify both the meter measurements and the topology information to conceal a cyber or physical attack. Conventional machine-learning-based detection methods against FDIA depend on the complete observability of power system topology, therefore cannot detect the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal learning model based on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) to detect this type of FDIA. First, GAE is used to learn the compact representation of power system topologies. Then, the obtained topological representation is fused with the measurement to obtain the multi-modal features. Third, ResNet is trained as a multi-label classifier to accept the fused features and generate an array, which can detect attack scenarios and identify the falsified measurements/topologies by coordinated attacks. Comprehensive case studies using IEEE 9-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems are presented. The simulation results show that, as compared to single feature methods, the proposed method is more effective in detecting coordinated state-and-topology attacks, and more robust in case of FDIA under unseen topological changes in power system operation.

A novel-cascaded ANFIS-based deep reinforcement learning for the detection of attack in cloud IoT-based smart city applications	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						cascaded adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; cloud; cyber-attack; internet of things; modified deep reinforcement learning; smart city	INTERNET	Vast usages of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various smart applications have laid a foundation for the evolution of modern smart cities. The increasing dependency of smart city applications on communication and information technologies enhances operational efficiency, sustainability, and automation of city services. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of IoT devices, the network faces critical security issues while executing continued network operations and services, particularly by cyber-attacks. One of the predominant and rampant cyber-attacks in smart city applications is botnet attacks. Therefore, a novel deep learning model for the detection and isolation of cyber-attacks is proposed in the cloud IoT-based smart city applications to protect against such cyber-attacks. The proposed framework utilizes two different modules to automatically detect and isolate the malicious traffic emanating from compromised IoT devices with more efficiency. Here, two different datasets namely the IoT network intrusion and the ISCX 2012 IDs datasets are utilized for the evaluation of the proposed framework. In the first phase, the compromised device which communicates malicious network traffics through the network is identified using a cascaded adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS). After detection, IP address of abnormal traffic is recorded and informed to the system administrator. In the second phase, communication pathways of compromised devices with other normal devices are blocked and the compromised devices are isolated from the network using the modified deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) approach. The analytic result shows that the proposed framework achieves a greater accuracy rate of about 98.7% as compared to other state-of-art methods.

Since modern infrastructure applications depend greatly on cyber technologies, these CPSs are exposed to two types of collusive network attacks, including unknown false data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. When a DoS attack is active, state variables are unavailable. Furthermore, when an FDI attack is launched, the general state is manipulated by the attacker. Inspired by these complications, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) candidate is employed to handle time delays, a neural network (NN) switched observer is applied to approximate unavailable system states under attacks, and a Nussbaum gain approach is implemented to deal with the unknown sign of the attack function. By using the common Lyapunov function, it is proved that all closed-loop system signals and tracking errors are bounded by the proposed resilient control.

J	Mahardhika, YM; Sudarsono, A; Barakbah, A				Mahardhika, Yesta Medya; Sudarsono, Amang; Barakbah, Aliridho			Botnet Detection Using On-line Clustering with Pursuit Reinforcement Competitive Learning (PRCL)	EMITTER-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Botnet Detection; Maliciouse Software; On-line Clustering; Pursuit Reinforcement Competitive Learning	BEHAVIOR	Botnet is a malicious software that often occurs at this time, and can perform malicious activities, such as DDoS, spamming, phishing, keylogging, clickfraud, steal personal information and important data. Botnets can replicate themselves without user consent. Several systems of botnet detection has been done by using classification methods. Classification methods have high precision, but it needs more effort to determine appropiate classification model. In this paper, we propose reinforced approach to detect botnet with Online Clustering using Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning involving interaction with the environment and became new paradigm in machine learning. The reinforcement learning will be implemented with some rule detection, because botnet ISCX dataset is categorized as unbalanced dataset which have high range of each number of class. Therefore we implemented Reinforcement Learning to Detect Botnet using Pursuit Reinforcement Competitive Learning (PRCL) with additional rule detection which has reward and punisment rules to achieve the solution. Based on the experimental result, PRCL can detect botnet in real time with high accuracy (100% for Neris, 99.9% for Rbot, 78% for SMTP_Spam, 80.9% for Nsis, 80.7% for Virut, and 96.0% for Zeus) and fast processing time up to 176 ms. Meanwhile the step of CPU and memory usage which are 78 % and 4.3 GB for pre-processing, 34% and 3.18 GB for online clustering with PRCL, and 23% and 3.11 GB evaluation. The proposed method is one solution for network administrators to detect botnet which has unpredictable behavior in network traffic.

Detection of false data injection attacks leading to line congestions using Neural networks	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Cyber-physical attacks; Neural networks; Smart grid security	STATE ESTIMATION; CYBER-ATTACK; SMART GRIDS; SYSTEM; DEEP	The connection between smart grids and buildings in smart cities can align energy supply and demand more efficiently with real-time communication. Because of the deep interactions between the cyber and physical systems, the detection of cyberattacks targeting the smart grid has become a challenge in recent years. False data injection (FDI) attacks can bypass the bad data detection algorithm to overflow multiple transmission lines and eventually cause cascading failures or blackouts. In this paper, a simplified neural network is developed to detect FDI attacks targeting transmission line overflows. Compared with the state-of-the-art that mainly focused on stealthy attacks bypassing state-estimation, the novelty of the proposed approach is detecting stealthy attacks that not only bypass the state-estimation, but also result in congestion of transmission lines in smart grids. A bad dataset, created by an attack model, is mixed with a set of clean data to train the proposed detection framework. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy of this method in detecting cyber-physical attacks. Also, several case studies are included to test the resilience of the proposed method in various scenarios.

In addition to this complexity, they have also been exposed to some important disturbances due to unintentional and intentional events since the number of cyber attacks has increased, and their behaviors have become more sophisticated. The openness, virtualization, and ubiquitous access traits of the combination of CPS and cloud computing may cause coupling problems. When malicious users or attackers simultaneously request the same physical nodes, it may lead to a failure of services as well as a security threat to the system. In this article, we design a low-coupling system based on the edge computing platform to counter coupling problems. The edge computing platform acts as a middleware platform and provides the scheduling method. Based on the edge computing platform and artificial intelligence technology, we design two buffer queues to reduce the coupling degree of the system in parallel. Moreover, we improve the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to obtain the maximum matching between users' requests and resources to achieve optimal resource distribution.

External attackers often utilize vulnerable IoT devices to invade the target's internal network and then further cause a security threat to the whole network. To prevent such attacks, it is necessary to develop a security mechanism to control the access of suspicious IoT devices and manage the internal devices. In recent years, deep learning (DL) algorithm has been widely used in the field of edge device identification (EDI), and has made great achievements. However, these previous methods are essentially centralized learning-based EDI (CentEDI) that trains all data together, which can not guarantee data security and not conducive to deployment on edge devices. To address this problem, we introduce a federated learning-based EDI (FedeEDI) method via network traffic to automatically identify edge devices connected to the whole network. Experimental results show that the training efficiency of our proposed FedeEDI method is much higher than that of the CentEDI method, although its classification accuracy is slightly reduced. In contrast to the CentEDI method, the proposed FedeEDI method has two main advantages: faster training speed and safer training process.

J	Almomani, A				Almomani, Ammar			Fast-flux hunter: a system for filtering online fast-flux botnet	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Botnets; Fast-flux networks (FFN); Zero-day attack; Evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN); Online detection		Fast-flux networks is a domain name system (DNS) technique used by botnets, which is hiding some attack like phishing and malware delivery sites behind associate dynamical network of compromised hosts acting as proxies, that sometimes hosts malicious content. Detection of fast-flux networks continues to be a difficult issue attributable to the similar behavior between these networks and alternative legitimate infrastructures, like server farms and content distribution networks. This study seeks to improve the detection and prediction of the unknown "zero-day" online fast-flux botnet. This improvement will be achieved using a new system called the fast-flux hunter (FFH), which supports a new adaptive evolving fuzzy neural network algorithm. The FFH system is a hybrid between the supervised and unsupervised online knowledge-based learning systems. The core mechanism of the FFH is based on the inherent feature of the fast-flux networks. It uses a collection of DNS traffic information. The FFH is able to scan over 7615 domain records and extract 14 distinct features for each domain. The FFH decreases the classification method's error rate. The FFH has a detection accuracy rate of approximately 98 % and is compatible with life-long learning systems, footprint-consuming memory, and high-speed systems.

Petri net as an important formal tool for modeling, analysis and analysis of distributed, parallel and real-time systems provides a solid foundation for CPS modeling. However, Petri nets lack the ability to describe spatial information, so it is impossible to fully model CPS. Incorrect system modeling can directly affect system reliability and even life-threatening and property safety, Therefore, when modeling and analyzing CPS characteristics, a more complete modeling method is needed. This paper extends the Defect extension time Petri net and constructs a spatiotemporal Petri net that can describe the positional changes of CPS physical entities. This paper also analyzes the physical characteristics of CPS in detail, starting from the classification and characteristics of physical entities, and deeply studying the properties of CPS physical entities and their location transition process. Proposing a formal modeling method for CPS physical entities; Introducing spatial factors on the basis of Petri nets by analyzing the characteristics that Petri nets must satisfy, getting the formal definition of Petri net, It can not only describe the physical entity logic and time-level behavior, hut also describe the state changes caused by physical entity location changes. Firstly, using petri net to finely model important equipment in information systems, and then based on these models and the attack source delivery path, establishing the fine Bayesian cyber attack model. With the combination of the observed real-time attack events, we dynamically update the probability of attack behavior based on Bayesian reasoning. Finally, we proposed the optimal load control algorithm considering the node failure, comprehensive quantitative assessing the impact of cyber attacks on the CPPS.

These links may contain URLs to mount targeted attacks like spamming, phishing, and malware installation. Using blacklist of URLs is the most widely used defense mechanism to detect a malicious URLs. However, automatically generating such a list for fresh malicious URLs is challenging. Detecting a URL as malicious using the lexicographical approach is an important research problem. This paper proposes a malicious URL detection mechanism using natural language processing. We use features including word vector representation obtained through GloVe along with statistical cues and n-gram on blacklist words. The proposed approach is efficient, and it does not require inputs from external servers to identify malicious URLs. Experiments are performed on 227,909 size database containing 80,128 benign and 147,781 malicious URLs. Proposed system has achieved an accuracy of 89% for ANN model with GloVe based features.

J	Kummerow, A; Alramlawi, M; Paul, S; Nicolai, S; Bretschneider, P				Kummerow, Andre; Alramlawi, Mansour; Paul, Sandipan; Nicolai, Steffen; Bretschneider, Peter			Space-Vector Neural Networks: Efficient Learning From Three-Phase Electrical Waveforms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Autoencoder; anomaly detection; time series; digital substation; cyber-attack; Autoencoder; anomaly detection; time series; digital substation; cyber-attack		During the past decades, significant progress has been made in the field of artificial neural networks to process image, text or speech information including Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformers. However, the processing of electrical three-phase waveforms using these general network architectures ignore important signal characteristics and therefore lack of computational efficiency. This can lead to performance problems and can limit the application of neural networks for a fast and efficient analysis of electrical three-phase signals. To address this issue, this paper presents space-vector neural networks as new model architecture to process electrical current or voltage waveforms. A novel space-vector encoding and decoding layer is introduced to learn meaningful representations for different downstream tasks. The performance of space-vector neural networks is compared with other neural network and statistical methods for the reconstruction of unbalanced three-phase voltage signals and the detection of cyber-attacks in digital substations using a benchmark dataset. In both case studies, the results show a superior computational efficiency of space-vector neural networks in terms of the required number of parameters as well as the execution times with comparable reconstruction accuracies and detection capabilities. This demonstrates the high application potential of space-vector neural networks in the substation automation.

In the domain of cybersecurity, the identification of the obfuscated Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a concerning facet. This study proposes a Robust unified TabNet ensemble model for the identification of Malicious URLs with feature extraction based on the computation of features' importance for classification. A fine-tuned attention-based deep neural network TabNet is used to extract the features of the URL. The customized data with the most important features is generated, and a Machine Learning (ML) ensemble model is developed for the classification of the URLs. The evaluation parameters accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are measured to look at the performance of the TabNet ensemble model. Accuracy of 97.8%, precision of 0.978, recall of 0.976, and F1-score of 0.978 reflect the outperforming results of the proposed model while classifying the five URL classes. The model is further validated through statistical analysis by measuring the Kappa value, which comes up as 0.968 for the proposed model. With a 10-fold cross-validation model, we attained a mean accuracy of 97.27% and a confidence interval of 0.004. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) explainable AI model is used to validate the model to perceive the contributing features towards the classification model. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art ML classifiers and the previous studies, and the whole validation process favors the proposed model's efficacy.

We present SRATTA an attack relying only on aggregated models which, under realistic assumptions, (i) recovers data samples from the different clients, and (ii) groups data samples coming from the same client together. While sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets. We also propose counter-measures, and claim that clients should play an active role to guarantee their privacy during training.

Therefore, to empower and protect Internet users, it is necessary to develop proper strategies and tools to encapsulate their needs, and identify and prevent all types of the information security risks that may arise during the use of the Internet. In this study, a tracking system to ensure the safe use of the Internet is proposed. Considering the distribution of its potential users, the system has an easy-to-use graphical user interface. By recognizing dangerous web sites and IP addresses, the proposed system blocks access to those sites and this way provides reliable Internet access to its users. During the Internet access, it analyzes accessed IP addresses and port numbers in terms of access type and time and informs the user of the corresponding port numbers which must be closed for safe Internet access. Moreover, by continuously checking the host redirection file of the computer it runs on, it identifies redirections from web addresses to specific IP addresses and this way provides protection against phishing attacks which are becoming one of the most common Internet threats. Although the proposed system is a simple application since it is an open source, freeware application designed for children, it can be improved to consider more sophisticated attack types.

Often dozens of analysts search a multitude of sources and collect, categorise, cluster, and rank news items from the clear and dark web in order to prepare the most relevant information for decision makers. A tool that supports this job is "Taranis NG" from the Slovakian CERT. This solution ingests information from many types of sources such as websites, RSS feeds, emails and social media channels and makes them searchable. It also supports the creation of reports and daily summaries. However, the number of sources and news items is continuously growing, making it increasingly difficult to search them purely manually. These circumstances call for the application of novel natural language processing (NLP) methods to make OSINT analysis more efficient.

It has changed the way of communication and information dissemination through its real-time messaging mechanism. Recently, it has been used by researchers and industries as a new source of data for various intelligent systems, such as tweet sentiment analysis and recommendation systems, which require high data quality. However, due to its flexibility and popularity, Twitter has become the main target for spamming activities such as phishing legitimate users or spreading malicious software, which introduces new security issues and waste resources. Therefore, researchers have developed various machine-learning algorithms to reveal Twitter spam. However, as spammers have become smarter and more crafty, the characteristics of the spam tweets are varying over time making these methods inefficient to detect new spammers tricks and strategies. In addition, some of the employed methods (e.g. blacklisting) or spammer features (e.g. graph-based features) are extremely time-consuming, which hinders the ability to detect spammer activities in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a framework to deal with the volatility of the spam contents and new spamming patterns, called the spam drift. The framework combines the strength of unsupervised machine learning approach, which learns from unlabeled tweets, to retrain a real-time supervised tweet-level spam detection model in a batch mode. A set of experiments on a large-scale data set show the effectiveness of the proposed online unsupervised method in adaptively discovers and learns the patterns of new spam activities and achieve stable recall values reaching more than 95%. Although the average spam precision of our method is around 60%, the high spam recall values show the ability of our proposed method in reducing spam drift problems compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

It utilizes training data to construct the internal logic of the deep neural networks. With aggressive development in various security-sensitive domains, deep learning raises safety concerns in academia and industrial community. Numerous researches have shown that even the most advanced deep learning systems have vulnerabilities leading to misbehaviors. Despite the urgent security threat, fuzzing test remains a reasonable way to solve the problem. However, The static parameters design in current mainstream neuron coverage disables the fuzzing work diversely on heterogeneous architectures. To address the above problems, we propose the Dynamic Adaptive Neuron Coverage (DANCe) to model the neuron behavior, which can adapt diverse models with implementing training data. The dynamic adaption mechanism enhances the ability of coverage-based fuzzing to generate adversarial examples as test cases. The proposed model is evaluated on two widely-adopted image datasets and four well-designed deep neural networks. The experimental results show that the DANCe exceeds the SOTA coverage criteria by 7% and 33% on generating adversarial examples within 1 hour and 6 hours of time limitation.

Recent research has introduced effective Machine Learning (ML) models for cyber-attack detection, promising to automate the task of detecting, tracking and blocking malware and intruders. Much less effort has been devoted to cyber-attack prediction, especially beyond the short-term time scale of hours and days. Approaches that can forecast attacks likely to happen in the longer term are desirable, as this gives defenders more time to develop and share defensive actions and tools. Today, long-term predictions of attack waves are mostly based on the subjective perceptiveness of experienced human experts, which can be impaired by the scarcity of cyber-security expertise. This paper introduces a novel ML-based approach that leverages unstructured big data and logs to forecast the trend of cyber-attacks at a large scale, years in advance. To this end, we put forward a framework that utilises a monthly dataset of major cyber incidents in 36 countries over the past 11 years, with new features extracted from three major categories of big data sources, namely the scientific research literature, news, blogs, and tweets. Our framework not only identifies future attack trends in an automated fashion, but also generates a threat cycle that drills down into five key phases that constitute the life cycle of all 42 known cyber threats.

However, the anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting in increasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing fraud on blockchain financial platforms. Thus, financial security has become a top priority in the blockchain ecosystem, calling for effective market regulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts from a graph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural network framework named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of accounts and further achieve account de-anonymization. Specifically, we first construct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using raw Ethereum data. Then we design a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone of our framework, which can effectively characterize the node level account features and subgraph-level behavior patterns. For alleviating account label scarcity, we further introduce contrastive self-supervision mechanism as regularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive experiments on Ethereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in account identification, yielding 1.13% similar to 4.93% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the effectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding the behavior of known participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that of the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in risk assessment and market regulation.

At the heart of all the malware delivery techniques are executable files (known as downloader trojans or droppers) that download other malware. Because the act of downloading software components from the Internet is not inherently malicious, benign and malicious downloaders are difficult to distinguish based only on their content and behavior. In this paper, we introduce the downloader-graph abstraction, which captures the download activity on end hosts, and we explore the growth patterns of benign and malicious graphs. Downloader graphs have the potential of exposing large parts of the malware download activity, which may otherwise remain undetected. By combining telemetry from anti-virus and intrusion-prevention systems, we reconstruct and analyze 19 million downloader graphs from 5 million real hosts. We identify several strong indicators of malicious activity, such as the growth rate, the diameter, and the Internet access patterns of downloader graphs. Building on these insights, we implement and evaluate a machine learning system for malware detection. Our system achieves a 96.0% true-positive rate, with a 1.0% false-positive rate, and detects malware an average of 9.24 days earlier than existing antivirus products. We also perform an external validation by examining a sample of unlabeled files that our system detects as malicious, and we find that 41.41% are blocked by anti-virus products.

CNN-OHGS: CNN-oppositional-based Henry gas solubility optimization model for autonomous vehicle control system	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article						autonomous vehicle system; CNN; cyber attack; distance; opposition&#8208; based HGS; speed difference	CYBER-SECURITY; ATTACKS	Numerous developments in technology toward autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) have been performed for so many years all over the world. As our day-to-day life is becoming progressively dependent on automation vehicle system and control devices, the craze on automation advancements is expected to move closer through scientific technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. From another point of view, the cyber threat to the AVS causes drastic accidents and traffic congestion by varying the speed differences among the vehicles. To overcome such shortcomings, this paper presented a convolutional neural network-oppositional-based Henry gas solubility optimization (CNN-OHGS) algorithm for an autonomous vehicle control system to enhance the robustness of the vehicle. At the same time, the attackers attempt to embed the faulty or defective data into the sensor readings of the autonomous vehicle to interrupt the optimal distances among the automated vehicles. Therefore to minimize such issues, our proposed framework employs the CNN-OHGS algorithm to reduce the distance variations among the vehicles thus ensuring the safety and optimal distance variation. Finally, the experimental analysis is conducted and the performance evaluation for various attacks, FID evaluation, and remorse function, and distance deviation for all sensor signal attacks are evaluated. The comparative analysis is made and we can clearly state that the proposed work has outperformed other existing approaches.

Over time, these accounts become an essential part of one's online identity. The account stores various personal data and contains one's network of acquaintances. Attackers seek to compromise user accounts for various malicious purposes, such as distributing spam, phishing, and much more. Timely detection of compromises becomes crucial for protecting users and social networks. This article proposes a novel system for detecting compromises of a social network account by considering both post behavior and textual content. A deep multi-layer perceptron-based autoencoder is leveraged to consolidate diverse features and extract underlying relationships. Experiments show that the proposed system outperforms previous techniques that considered only behavioral information.

MALT<SUP>P</SUP>: Parallel Prediction of Malicious Tweets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; phishing; predictive modeling; security; social media	SPAM	It has been reported that embedded URLs and multimodal content (images, video, and sound recordings) in tweets are increasingly used to seduce users into a "wrong click," leading to malware infection. In this paper, we predict whether a tweet is malicious or not by examining five classes of features: textual content including sentiment, paths emanating from a URL mentioned in the tweet, attributes associated with URLs, and multimodal content in the tweet. A fifth class of features first constructs a novel "tweet graph" and then defines features by analyzing "metapaths" contained in the tweet graph. Next, we propose a MALicious Tweets in Parallel (MALT(P)) collective classification algorithm that merges together tweet graphs, metapaths, and collective classification proposed previously in the literature. We conduct detailed experiments using two data sets- Warningbird (WB) and KBA. We show that our metapath-based approach outperforms past efforts at identifying malicious tweets and further show that metapath-based features in conjunction with Alexa ranks and features from KBA yield very high predictive accuracy-over 0.98 on KBA and over 0.94 on KBA, outperforming past work. More significantly, metapath features alone generate a predictive accuracy of 0.977 and 0.923, respectively, on the KBA and WB data sets, significantly outperforming the other methods in isolation. We conduct a further analysis to identify the most important features; surprisingly, our results show that the presence of multimodal content is not a major factor and that metapath-based features dominate in separating malicious from benign tweets.

People from different countries and languages can now interact with each other thanks to state-of-the-art translators from prominent software companies like Google and Microsoft. However, these tools are also used to expand the audience for phishing attacks, scam emails or to generate fake reviews to promote a product on different e-commerce platforms. In all these cases, detecting whether a text has been translated can be crucial information. In this work, we tackle the problem of the detection of translated texts from different angles. On top of addressing the classic task of machine translation detection, we investigate and find common patterns across different machine translation systems unrelated to the original text's source language. Then, we show that it is possible to identify the machine translation system used to generate a translated text with high performances (F1-score 88.5%) and that it is also possible to identify the source language of the original text. We perform our tasks over two datasets that we use to evaluate our models: Books, a new dataset we built from scratch based on excerpts of novels, and the well-known Europarl dataset, based on proceedings of the European Parliament.

Secure intrusion detection system for IOT sensor data using LR-ECC and FY-SFL-DLNN algorithm	JOURNAL OF CONTROL AND DECISION			English	Article						Intrusion detection (ID); internet of things (IoT); feature reduction; classification; Brownian motion (BM); round-off log value-centred elliptic curve cryptography (LR-ECC); fisher yates-shuffled frog leaping-deep learning neural network (FY-SFL-DLNN); exponential kernel-centred linear discriminant analysis (EK-LDA); Brownian motion-based K-means algorithm (BM-KMA); cyber-attack		Identification and prevention of intrusions is the primary challenge in high-speed networks like IoT. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been developed already by researchers; but, they are not fully capable of protecting the network. Conventional methods do not optimise their learning models and ignore feature reduction. This negatively impacts the accuracy, efficiency, computation time, and security of the conventional IDS. Hence, this paper proposed a Secure IDS by utilising LR-ECC and FY-SFL-DLNN. Initially, the input dataset is preprocessed and the features are extracted from the data. Utilising the EK-LDA, the features are decreased. After that, utilising the BM-KMA, the data separation occurs. Lastly, by employing FY-SFL-DLNN, data classification is performed. Thus, the IoT sensor data is safely transmitted by utilising the LR-ECC algorithm after detection. Grounded on the experimental outcomes, the proposed work's performance is analogised with the conventional techniques for validating the proposed system's effectiveness.

J	Panthi, M; Das, TK				Panthi, Manikant; Das, Tanmoy Kanti			Stacking-based multi-objective approach for detection of smart power grid attacks using evolutionary ensemble learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES			English	Article						non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; cyber-attack; power grid; machine learning	FALSE DATA INJECTION; SYSTEM	Smart power grid (SPG) has gained a reputation as the advanced paradigm of the power grid. It provides a medium for exchanging real-time data between the company and users through the advanced metering infrastructure delivering transparent and resilient service to electricity consumers. The widespread deployment of remotely accessible networked equipment for grid monitoring and control has vastly increased the surface of SPG for attackers to locate vulnerable points. The early and accurate identification of the above counteracts is paramount to ensure stable and efficient power distribution. This paper proposes a stacking-based multi-objective evolutionary ensemble scheme to identify various attacks in the SPG. The proposed method used a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to learn the non-linear, overlapping, and complex electrical grid features to predict the type of malicious attacks. The experimental results and comparison using multiclass dataset validate the presented 'Stacking-NSGA-II' approach notably outperformed the others benchmark classifiers.

This paper explores the poisoning attack against the convolutional neural network under black-box conditions. The proposed attack is "black-box," which means the attacker has no knowledge about the targeted model's structure and parameters when attacking the model, and it uses "poisonous-labels" images, fake images with crafted wrong labels, as poisons. We present a method for generating "poisonous-label" images that use Enhanced Conditional DCGAN (EC-DCGAN) to synthesizes fake images and uses asymmetric poisoning vectors to mislabel them. We evaluate our method by generating "poisonous-label" images from MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets and using them to manipulate image classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate that, similarly to white box data poisoning attacks, the poisonous label attack can also dramatically increase the classification error.

J	Zhou, M; Han, LS				Zhou, Man; Han, Lansheng			Sensor Spoofing Detection On Autonomous Vehicle Using Channel-spatial-temporal Attention Based Autoencoder Network	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Autonomous vehicle; Spoofing attack; Channel-temporal attention; Autoencoder network		Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on various sensors to evaluate their surroundings and issue essential control commands. Nonetheless, these sensors are susceptible to false data injection and spoofing attacks, posing a significant security threat. In response, this paper proposes a channel-spatial-temporal attention-based autoencoder network to detect sensor spoofing attacks on autonomous vehicles. The innovative network utilizes the reconstruction error based on the autoencoder to detect abnormalities in input time series data collected from multiple sensors. The proposed model consists of a memory-augmented based spatial-attention block and PSE-Res2Net block-based encoder and decoder. PSE-Res2Net block initially adopts Res2Net module to generate a multi-scale feature graph and enhance multi-dimensional representation ability of neural network, then applies the PSENet module to capture location-aware channel information and channel-sensitive spatial information through the interaction of channel attention and spatial attention. Moreover, the memory-augmented based temporal-attention block is developed to integrate multi-scale features and aggregate global sequence information of sensor measurements. Experimental evaluations conducted on the comma2k19, KITTI, and CCSAD datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed detection model over baseline technologies. It exhibits enhanced performance in terms of mPre, mRe, mF1 score, and showcases heightened resilience against noise and attacks.

Hence, several detection/prevention techniques were developed to frustrate such cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a new inclusive discovery scheme that evaluate five supervised machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, decision trees, linear/quadratic discriminant, naive Bayes, and ensemble boosted trees. We compared the performance of these models via detection accuracy using a contemporary dataset for port scanning attacks (PSA-2017). As a result, the best performance results have recorded for logistic regression based detection scheme with 99.4%, 99.9%, 99.4%, 99.7%, and 0.454 mu Sec registered for accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and detection overhead. Lastly, the comparison with existing models exhibited the proficiency and advantage of our model with enhanced attack discovery speed.

Detecting fraudulent websites has been a concurrent task of both academia and industry in combating this type of attack. A common approach is to use supervised methods and labeled data to locate suspicious cases. In this paper, we evaluate a set of more common features related to the development and deployment aspects of websites that have been widely used in detecting scam and phishing websites over the years. As threat actors and the defense community are in a cat-and-mouse game, we aim to investigate whether such features are still prevalent or how to move forward in determining signs of malice when looking at the problem space at scale. Our study challenges the efficacy of deployment-based features, such as infrastructure providers or certificate issuers, in detecting fraudulent websites. Additionally, we perform an empirical analysis of the development aspects of websites that can be utilized in the detection pipeline.

J	Dracewicz, W; Sepczuk, M				Dracewicz, Weronika; Sepczuk, Mariusz			Detecting Fake Accounts on Social Media Portals-The X Portal Case Study	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fake account detection; Twitter (X); machine learning; image classification	NEWS	Today, social media are an integral part of everyone's life. In addition to their traditional uses of creating and maintaining relationships, they are also used to exchange views and all kinds of content. With the development of these media, they have become the target of various attacks. In particular, the existence of fake accounts on social networks can lead to many types of abuse, such as phishing or disinformation, which is a big challenge nowadays. In this work, we present a solution for detecting fake accounts on the X portal (formerly Twitter). The main goal behind the developed solution was to use images of X portal accounts and perform image classification using machine learning. As a result, it was possible to detect real and fake accounts and indicate the type of a particular account. The created solution was trained and tested on an adequately prepared dataset containing 15,000 generated accounts and real X portal accounts. The CNN model performing with accuracy above 92% and manual test results allow us to conclude that the proposed solution can be used to detect false accounts on the X portal.

However, backdoor attacks pose severe security threat to the subsequent models built upon compromised pre-trained models, which call for effective countermeasures to mitigate the backdoor threat before deploying the victim models to safety-critical applications. This paper proposes Purifier: a novel backdoor mitigation framework for pretrained models via suppressing anomaly activation. Purifier is motivated by the observation that, for backdoor triggers, anomaly activation patterns exist across different perspectives (e.g., channelwise, cube-wise, and feature-wise), featuring different degrees of granularity. More importantly, choosing to suppress at the right granularity is vital to robustness and accuracy. To this end, Purifier is capable of defending against diverse types of backdoor triggers without any prior knowledge of the backdoor attacks, meanwhile featuring a convenient and flexible characteristic during deployment, i.e., plug-and-play-able. The extensive experimental results show, against a series of state-of-the-art mainstream attacks, that Purifier performs better in terms of both defense effectiveness and model inference accuracy on clean examples than the state-of-the-art methods.

Operating failures in these systems can cause serious risks for society. To avoid or minimize downtime, operators require real-time awareness about critical incidents. However, online event identification in CPSs is challenged by the complex interdependency of numerous physical and digital components, requiring to take cyber attacks and physical failures equally into account. The online event identification problem is further complicated through the lack of historical observations of critical but rare events, and the continuous evolution of cyber attack strategies. This work introduces and demonstrates CyPhERS, a Cyber-Physical Event Reasoning System. CyPhERS provides real-time information pertaining the occurrence, location, physical impact, and root cause of potentially critical events in CPSs, without the need for historical event observations. Key novelty of CyPhERS is the capability to generate informative and interpretable event signatures of known and unknown types of both cyber attacks and physical failures. The concept is evaluated and benchmarked on a demonstration case that comprises a multitude of attack and fault events targeting various components of a CPS. The results demonstrate that the event signatures provide relevant and inferable information on both known and unknown event types.

To alleviate privacy concerns, FL essentially promises that multiple parties jointly train the model by exchanging gradients rather than raw data. However, intrinsic privacy issue still exists in FL, e.g., user's training samples could be revealed by solely inferring gradients. Moreover, the emerging poisoning attack also poses a crucial security threat to FL. In particular, due to the distributed nature of FL, malicious users may submit crafted gradients during the training process to undermine the integrity and availability of the model. Furthermore, there exists a contradiction in simultaneously addressing two issues, that is, privacy-preserving FL solutions are dedicated to ensuring gradients indistinguishability, whereas the defenses against poisoning attacks tend to remove outliers based on their similarity. To solve such a dilemma, in this paper, we aim to build a bridge between the two issues. Specifically, we present a privacy-enhanced FL (PEFL) framework that adopts homomorphic encryption as the underlying technology and provides the server with a channel to punish poisoners via the effective gradient data extraction of the logarithmic function. To the best of our knowledge, the PEFL is the first effort to efficiently detect the poisoning behaviors in FL under ciphertext. Detailed theoretical analyses illustrate the security and convergence properties of the scheme. Moreover, the experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that the PEFL can effectively defend against label-flipping and backdoor attacks, two representative poisoning attacks in FL.

While widely studied, the psychology of deception has largely focused on physical cues of deception. Given that present-day communication among humans is largely electronic, we focus on the cyber domain where physical cues are unavailable and for which there is less psychological research. To improve cyber defense, researchers have used signaling theory to extended algorithms developed for the optimal allocation of limited defense resources by using deceptive signals to trick the human mind. However, the algorithms are designed to protect against adversaries that make perfectly rational decisions. In behavioral experiments using an abstract cybersecurity game (i.e., Insider Attack Game), we examined human decision-making when paired against the defense algorithm. We developed an instance-based learning (IBL) model of an attacker using the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture to investigate how humans make decisions under deception in cyber-attack scenarios. Our results show that the defense algorithm is more effective at reducing the probability of attack and protecting assets when using deceptive signaling, compared to no signaling, but is less effective than predicted against a perfectly rational adversary. Also, the IBL model replicates human attack decisions accurately. The IBL model shows how human decisions arise from experience, and how memory retrieval dynamics can give rise to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias. The implications of these findings are discussed in the perspective of informing theories of deception and designing more effective signaling schemes that consider human bounded rationality.

J	Ge, WH; Wang, JF; Lin, TC; Tang, BH; Li, XH				Ge, Wenhan; Wang, Junfeng; Lin, Tongcan; Tang, Binhui; Li, Xiaohui			Explainable cyber threat behavior identification based on self-adversarial topic generation	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Cyber threat intelligence; Tactics; Techniques and procedures; Explainable artificial intelligence; Self -Adversarial training; Topic generation and classification	INTELLIGENCE	Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides ample evidence and information regarding the detection of cyber attack activities. Existing methods employ CTI reports to extract Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for attack detection. Nevertheless, these methods are challenged in providing necessary and sufficient evidentiary support for recognition decisions, making it difficult for human operators to comprehend and accept the decision-making process. This paper proposes a topic prototype-based explainable TTPs classification approach, which provides accurate boundaries for key evidences to justify the results of TTPs classification. The proposed method introduces a self-adversarial framework for obtaining necessary and sufficient evidence for TTPs classification. The framework consists of an evidence generator and a TTPs classifier discriminator. The evidence generator utilizes a topic prototype-based keyword importance filtering method to extract evidence from CTI text while removing noise, resulting in an evidence set and a perturbation set. Subsequently, the impact of the evidence set and the perturbation set on TTPs classification is assessed using our siamese discriminator. The discriminator is specifically trained to ensure that only the elements belonging to the evidence set are accurately classified as TTPs information. The experiments primarily test the necessity and sufficiency of TTPs and evidence. In the sufficiency evaluations, classical deep learning methods are used for TTPs classification to verify the accuracy of the results, where the proposed method improves the Micro F1 scores by 0.16% to 6.63% and Macro F1s by 0.26% to 6.85%. To prove necessity, various case-based explainable methods are used to measure the completeness of CTI evidence. The results shows that the proposed method is able to obtain more stable prediction, more reasonable evidence sets, and more significant boundaries.

Technological advancements like Tor, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies allow criminals to carry out these activities anonymously, leading to increased use of the Darkweb. At the same time, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping our behavior, and influencing how we interact with each other and the world. This work carries out the bibliometric study on the research conducted on Darkweb over the last decade. The findings illustrate that most research on Darkweb can be clustered into four areas based on keyword co-occurrence analysis: (i) network security, malware, and cyber-attacks, (ii) cybercrime, data privacy, and cryptography, (iii) machine learning, social media, and artificial intelligence, and (iv) drug trafficking, cryptomarket. National Science Foundation from the United States is the top funder. Darkweb activities interfere with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) laid forth by the United Nations to promote peace and sustainability for current and future generations. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) has the highest number of publications and citations but has an inverse relationship with Darkweb, as the latter undermines the former. This study highlights the need for further research in bitcoin, blockchain, IoT, NLP, cryptocurrencies, phishing and cybercrime, botnets and malware, digital forensics, and electronic crime countermeasures about the Darkweb. The study further elucidates the multi-dimensional nature of the Darkweb, emphasizing the intricate relationship between technology, psychology, and geopolitics. This comprehensive understanding serves as a cornerstone for evolving effective countermeasures and calls for an interdisciplinary research approach. The study also delves into the psychological motivations driving individuals towards illegal activities on the Darkweb, highlighting the urgency for targeted interventions to promote pro-social online behavior.

The FSA analyzes time-series signals in the frequency domain to identify patterns in their frequency spectrum. It learns the distribution of dominant frequencies in a dataset of healthy signals. Subsequently, it manipulates the amplitudes of dominant frequencies within this healthy distribution, ensuring a stealthy attack against statistical analysis of the signal spectrum. We evaluated the performance of FSA on LSTM, a state-of-the-art network for load forecasting. The results show that FSA can triple the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of predictions compared to the normal case and increase it by 70% compared to noise injection attacks. Furthermore, FSA indirectly enhances battery utilization in the EMS by 45%. We then proposed a detection method that combines statistical analysis and machine-learning-based classification techniques with features. The model effectively distinguishes FSA from healthy and noisy signals, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% and an F1-score of 98.1% on a load dataset, covering healthy, FSA, and noisy load data. Finally, a countermeasure was introduced based on the statistical analysis of the frequency spectrum of healthy signals to mitigate the impact of FSA. This countermeasure successfully reduces the MAE of the attacked model from 0.135 to 0.053, validating its effectiveness in mitigating FSA.

However, as indicated by a recent black-box attack, existing defenses can be easily bypassed by implanting the backdoor in the frequency domain. To this end, we propose a new defense DTINSPECTOR against black-box backdoor attacks, based on a new observation related to the prediction confidence of learning models. That is, to achieve a high attack success rate with a small amount of poisoned data, backdoor attacks usually render a model exhibiting statistically higher prediction confidences on the poisoned samples. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the generality of this observation. DTINSPECTOR then carefully examines the prediction confidences of data samples, and decides the existence of backdoor using the shortcut nature of backdoor triggers. Extensive evaluations on six backdoor attacks, four datasets, and three advanced attacking types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense.

Network traffic matrices are a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing networks and are broadly taught in online graph theory educational resources. Network traffic matrix concepts are rarely available in online computer network and cybersecurity educational resources. To fill this gap, an interactive game environment has been developed to teach the foundations of traffic matrices 10 the computer networking community. The game environment provides a convenient, broadly accessible, delivery mechanism that enables making material available rapidly to a wide audience. The core architecture of the game is a facility to add new network traffic matrix training modules via an easily editable JSON file. Using this facility an initial set of modules were rapidly created covering: basic traffic matrices, traffic patterns, security/defense/deterrence, a notional cyber attack, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and a variety of graph theory concepts. The game environment enables delivery in a wide range of contexts to enable rapid feedback and improvement. The game can be used as a core unit as part of a formal course or as a simple interactive introduction in a presentation.

This article proposes the fault and attack location and classification (FALCON) system to classify and locate cyber and physical anomalies, including false data injection attacks on protection devices, replay attacks on communication networks, and physical faults on distribution lines. The proposed system takes as input the transient short-circuit current and voltage measured by protection relays, the relays command status as well as the fault alarm from fault indicators, which is fed into a deep neural network that classifies and identifies the location of the fault and attacks in the distribution system. Numerical studies demonstrate FALCON's capability to classify and locate multiple cyber and physical anomalies with more than 98% accuracy, even when multiple devices are simultaneously compromised. Furthermore, the impact of different sets of input data is explored to highlight the importance of fault indicators, fault voltage data, and data collected from the RES relays.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one approach for the detection of cyber-attacks. FS is required to reduce the dimensionality of data and improve the performance of the IDS. One of the reasons for the failure of an IDS is incorrect selection of features because most of the FS methods are based on a limited number of objectives such as accuracy or relevance of data, but these are not enough as they can be misleading for attack detection the contribution of this work is to develop appropriate FS method. They have implemented the nondominated sorting algorithm with its adapted jumping gene operator to solve the optimisation problem and exploited an extreme learning machine as the classifier for FS based on six important objectives for an IoT network. Experimental results verify that the proposed method performs well for FS and have achieved 99.9% and has reduced the total number of features by nearly 90%. The proposed method outperforms other proposed FS methods for the detection of DDoS attacks by an IDS.

In such an environment, malicious SDN applications can be easily developed and distributed by untrusted entities and can even possess full control of SDNs. Thus, the security threat of malicious SDN applications must be taken seriously. In this paper, we propose a novel system, called Indago, which statically analyzes SDN applications to model their behavioral profiles, and finally, it automatically detects malicious SDN applications with a machine learning approach. We implement a prototype system and evaluate its effectiveness with real world SDN applications and malware. Our evaluation results show that the system can detect most known SDN malware with a high detection rate and low error rates.

The significant advantages of this scheme are two folds: on the one hand, it achieves system-level privacy-preserving control to eliminate eavesdropping attacks; on the other hand, it designs a reliable intrusion-tolerant method to eliminate the disruptive impact of stealthy attacks by integrating attack detection-based network blocking defense and open-loop control defense. Note that, the system-level privacy-preserving is achieved based on the output masking, privacy-preserving optimization, and input encryption; the open-loop control defense is achieved based on one-step-ahead predictive interpolating control method. Sufficient numerical comparisons are given to verify the validity of these results.

Prompt detection can mitigate the impact of several attacks including Denial-of-service (DDoS), spam, phishing, identity theft, and information leaking. Actually, physical and logical appliances over networks are addressing botnet discovery. However, signature-based solutions require constant updates from repositories, which is a concerning setback given the rapid development of new threats. An alternative solution to overcome such limitations is to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to accurately identify malicious network flows. Although the state-of-the-art provide significant advances in botnet classification using machine and statistical learning, the algorithm selection procedure is not properly defined nor explained. In this work an algorithm portfolio is built to test performance between several supervised learning algorithms using a hyper-parameter optimization technique known as Grid Search. Experimental results prove that by tuning algorithms trained models can outperform detection accuracy in an efficient manner.

J	Guha, D				Guha, Dipayan			Fuzzy-aided finite-time frequency controller of renewable-integrated power systems with hydrogen energy storage	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						DoS cyber-attack; Frequency regulation; Fixed-time control; Fuzzy disturbance observer; Hydrogen energy storage; Lyapunov stability; Resiliency	SLIDING MODE CONTROL; DISTURBANCE OBSERVER; DESIGN	Reliable frequency regulation of power systems integrated with low-inertia variable renewable energy gen-erations (REGs) is crucial in islanded mode operation. It demands a resilient control framework to uphold grid stability/security against undeniable physical disturbances/cyber-attacks. This work maidenly develops and applies a fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO)-based resilient frequency controller to advance the dynamic stability of REGs-integrated large-scale power plants. Further, to enhance the damping of frequency/power oscillations, hydrogen energy storage (HES) has been incorporated, and its effectiveness is analyzed. The estimated disturbance using FDO is augmented into secondary control law derived from a non-singular terminal sliding mode strategy to increase active disturbance rejection proficiency of the overall closed-loop system. The global exponential finite-time stability of the testbed under the developed control framework has been rigorously reviewed using the Lyapunov theory. The qualitative assessment of simulation outcomes has confirmed the proficiency and resiliency of the developed control framework regarding superior frequency regulation against unknown disturbance inputs. The practicability of the developed control framework has been further quantified on IEEE 68-bus large-scale testbed, and a comparative study is presented following unknown/uncertain disturbances. Lastly, the cyber-tolerance of the applied resilient controller has been established against detectable DoS cyber-attack.

Dual-hybrid intrusion detection system to detect False Data Injection in smart grids	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; ATTACKS	Modernizing power systems into smart grids has introduced numerous benefits, including enhanced efficiency, reliability, and integration of renewable energy sources. However, this advancement has also increased vulnerability to cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in identifying sophisticated FDIAs due to their reliance on predefined rules and signatures. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel IDS that utilizes hybrid feature selection and deep learning classifiers to detect FDIAs in smart grids. The main objective is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of IDS in smart grids. The proposed methodology combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for hybrid feature selection, ensuring the selection of the most relevant features for detecting FDIAs. Additionally, the IDS employs a hybrid deep learning classifier that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the smart grid data's spatial and temporal features. The dataset used for evaluation, the Industrial Control System (ICS) Cyber Attack Dataset (Power System Dataset) consists of various FDIA scenarios simulated in a smart grid environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS framework significantly outperforms traditional methods. The hybrid feature selection effectively reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, improving computational efficiency and detection performance. The hybrid deep learning classifier performs better in key metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. Precisely, the proposed approach attains higher accuracy by accurately identifying true positives and minimizing false negatives, ensuring the reliable operation of smart grids. Recall is enhanced by capturing critical features relevant to all attack types, while precision is improved by reducing false positives, leading to fewer unnecessary interventions. The F-measure balances recall and precision, indicating a robust and reliable detection system. This study presents a practical dual-hybrid IDS framework for detecting FDIAs in smart grids, addressing the limitations of existing IDS techniques. Future research should focus on integrating real-world smart grid data for validation, developing adaptive learning mechanisms, exploring other bio-inspired optimization algorithms, and addressing real-time processing and scalability challenges in large-scale deployments.

The presence of 'selfish' nodes distributed in the network are taken into account as an important challenge and as a security threat in VANET. A selfish node is a legitimate vehicle node which tries to achieve the most benefit from the network by broadcasting wrong information. An efficient and proper security model can be useful to tackle advances from attackers, as well as selfish nodes. In this study, a privacy-preserving node and message authentication scheme, along with a trust model was developed. The proposed node authentication ensures the legitimacy of the vehicle nodes, whereas the message authentication was developed to ensure the message's integrity. To deal with selfish nodes, an experience-based trust model was also designed. Additionally, to fulfill the privacy-preserving aspect, the mapping of each vehicle was performed using a different pseudo-identity. In this paper, fog nodes instead of road-side units (RSUs), were distributed along the roadside. This was mainly because of the fact that fog computing reduces latency, and results in increased throughput. Security analysis indicated that our scheme met the VANETs' security requirements. In addition, the performance analysis showed that the proposed scheme had a lower communication and computation overhead, compared to the other related works. Monte-Carlo simulation results were applied to estimate the false-positive rates (FPR), which also proved the validity of the proposed security scheme. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The confidentiality, availability, and integrity of a user's financial information stored in an electronic wallet can be compromised by threats such as phishing, malware, and social engineering; therefore, fintech platforms employ intelligent fraud detection mechanisms to mitigate the problem. The purpose of this study is to detect fraudulent activity using cutting-edge machine learning techniques on data obtained from the leading e-wallet platform in Turkey. After a comprehensive analysis of the dataset's features via feature engineering procedures, we found that the LightGBM approach had the highest detection accuracy of fraudulent activity with 97% in the experiments conducted. An additional key objective of reducing false alerts was accomplished, as the number of false alarms went from 13,024 to 6,249. This approach resulted in the establishment of a machine-learning model suitable for use by relatively small fraud detection teams.

Cyber Extortion Unveiled: The Evolution, Tactics, Challenges, and Future of Ransomware	2023 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, CSCI 2023	International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)	DEC 13-15, 2023	Las Vegas, NV			Ransomware; Encryption; Cybersecurity Mitigation; Double extortion; Threat landscape; Interdisciplinary integration		The adaptability and malicious efficiency of ransomware, a sort of malicious software that encrypts files or restricts system access until a ransom, frequently in the form of cryptocurrency, is delivered to the attacker, is unmatched by other computer dangers. This article covers ransomware's unrelenting evolution, from its historical roots to sophisticated modern varieties that use cutting-edge encryption and the ominous "double extortion" tactic. Attacks with ransomware offer serious risks, including financial hardships, breaches of data privacy, interruptions of vital infrastructure, and psychological effects on victims. The paper explores encryption methods, such as the AES and RSA algorithms, and finds common entry vectors for ransomware, including social engineering, phishing emails, and software weaknesses. It highlights difficulties in ransomware mitigation, including dangers in the supply chain, human weaknesses, resource limitations, ransomware's dynamic nature, encryption and evasion strategies, data exfiltration, and cryptocurrency transactions. Application whitelisting, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence are all examples of mitigation methods. Response strategies like data backups and incident response plans are examples of mitigation strategies. The efficacy analysis highlights the necessity for a comprehensive strategy by highlighting strengths and shortcomings. The review advocates for interdisciplinary integration to combat the evolving ransomware threat landscape by outlining promising approaches and future research needs, such as multi-modal authentication techniques, resilience-centric security measures, ransomware attribution techniques, and user-centric security designs.

Traditional manual-based methods to manage this behavior have poor monitoring effects and high costs. As for automatic management systems using artificial intelligence (AI), the deployment method matters. Cloud-based deployment methods have the disadvantages of high latency, high risk of privacy leakage, and heavy network transmission loads. In this paper, we propose a highly secure edge-intelligent electric motorcycle management system for elevators. By using edge-based deployment method, the monitor pictures are processed locally without being uploaded to the cloud, which can effectively resist network attacks and prevent residents' private data from being leaked. To improve the system security, we fully analyze the challenges faced in the application scenarios and introduce security threat identification (STI-1H8) model to identify the security threats. In addition, we propose several data enhancement methods to improve the system recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that our system can achieve a high recall rate of 0.82. By using data enhancement and data mixing strategies, it can reduce the misjudgment rate by 0.35. Moreover, compared to cloud computing, our edge-based method can reduce the latency by 19.6%, meeting real-time requirements.

J	Alazab, M				Alazab, Mamoun			Profiling and classifying the behavior of malicious codes	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Cybercrime; Malware; Profiling	MALWARE	Malware is a major security threat confronting computer systems and networks and has increased in scale and impact from the early days of ICE Traditional protection mechanisms are largely incapable of dealing with the diversity and volume of malware variants which is evident today. This paper examines the evolution of malware including the nature of its activity and variants, and the implication of this for computer security industry practices. As a first step to address this challenge, I propose a framework to extract features statically and dynamically from malware that reflect the behavior of its code such as the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls. Similarity based mining and machine learning methods have been employed to profile and classify malware behaviors. This method is based on the sequences of API sequence calls and frequency of appearance. Experimental analysis results using large datasets show that the proposed method is effective in identifying known malware variants, and also classifies malware with high accuracy and low false alarm rates. This encouraging result indicates that classification is a viable approach for similarity detection to help detect malware. This work advances the detection of zero-day malware and offers researchers another method for understanding impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mimura, M				Mimura, Mamoru			An Improved Method of Detecting Macro Malware on an Imbalanced Dataset	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Malware; Feature extraction; Large scale integration; Training; Semantics; Indexing; Computers; Information security; intrusion detection; machine learning; VBA macros; office documents; macro malware; natural language processing; Doc2vec; latent semantic indexing	OFFICE DOCUMENTS; PDF	In spear-phishing attacks, macro malware written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is often used to compromise the target computers. Macro malware is often obfuscated in several ways to evade detection. To detect new macro malware, several methods with machine learning techniques have been proposed. While many methods were evaluated with the inadequate or balanced dataset with the same number of benign and malicious samples, practical performance is still open to discussion. In reality, the population of VBA macros consists of wide variety of samples. To evaluate practical performance, an imbalanced dataset which contains many benign samples is required. In this paper, we propose an improved method of detecting macro malware on an imbalanced dataset. Our method uses 2 language models (Doc2vec and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)) and 4 popular classifiers. These language models are used to extract features and mitigate the class imbalance problem by selecting important features. We create an imbalanced dataset with more than 30,000 samples and evaluate the practical performance. The experimental result demonstrates that our method mitigates the class imbalance problem and could detect completely new malware regardless of the family type. The result also reveals that LSI is more robust than Doc2vec to the class imbalance problem.

To this end, sound classification systems are widely adopted and integrated into several smart devices to continuously monitor the environment. However, sound classification algorithms are prone to adversarial attacks that pose a considerable security threat to smart service systems where they are integrated. In this paper, we devise HIJACK, a novel machine learning framework entailing five neural network strategies to enforce the robustness of sound classification systems to adversarial noise injection. The HIJACK methodologies can be applied to any neural network-based sound classifier and consist of tailored transformations of the input audio during training along with specific additional layers added to the neural network architecture. To assess the noise robustness provided by the HIJACK strategies, we design a measure based on a L-2-adversarial attack to sound classification identified as the normalized fast gradient method (NFGM) - that constructs the adversarial noise by maximizing the sound mis-classification probability. We assessed the robustness of HIJACK to the proposed NFGM attack on a publicly available dataset. The results show that the combination of the five HIJACK strategies allows reaching robustness to adversarial noise 58 times larger than state-of-the-art neural networks for sound classification, guaranteeing a classification accuracy above 83%.

In EI environments, agreement among multiple computers is essential for power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption etc. applications. Coordinated control and security protection play important roles in the application of a distributed computing environment. A consensus approach can provide fault tolerance and prevent system errors and attacks, thereby providing the system with strong security in distributed computing environment. In this paper, a distributed Kalman filter with consensus coordinated control algorithm for multiagent systems (MAS) was proposed to investigate the energy internet with links failure by cyber attack. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in the energy internet through a MAS model using MATLAB software.

J	Kushwah, GS; Ranga, V				Kushwah, Gopal Singh; Ranga, Virender			Optimized extreme learning machine for detecting DDoS attacks in cloud computing	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Cloud computing; DDoS attack; Artificial neural network; Extreme learning machine; Differential evolution	MULTIPLE CROSSOVER OPERATORS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SYNERGY; IDS	Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a serious security threat to cloud computing that affects the availability of cloud services. Therefore, defending against these attacks becomes imperative. In this paper, we present a DDoS attack detection system based on an improved Self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM). SaE-ELM model is improved by incorporating two more features. Firstly, it can adapt the best suitable crossover operator. Secondly, it can automatically determine the appropriate number of hidden layer neurons. These features improve the learning and classification capabilities of the model. The proposed system is evaluated using four datasets namely, NSL-KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017. It achieves the detection accuracy of 86.80%, 98.90%, 89.17%, and 99.99% with NSL-KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017 datasets, respectively. The experiments show that the performance of the proposed attack detection system is better than the system based on original SaE-ELM and state-of-the-art techniques. However, it shows a longer training time than SaE-ELM based system. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The complexity of this approach (combined with the intricate function of the fast-flux "botnet" networks) is the cause of an extremely risky threat which is hard to trace. In most of the cases it should be faced as zero-day vulnerability. This kind of combined attacks is responsible for malware distribution and for the infection of Information Systems. Moreover it is related to illegal actions, like money mule recruitment sites, phishing websites, illicit online pharmacies, extreme or illegal adult content sites, malicious browser exploit sites and web traps for distributing virus. Traditional digital security mechanisms face such vulnerabilities in a conventional manner, they create often false alarms and they fail to forecast them. This paper proposes an innovative fast and accurate evolving Smart URL Filter (eSURLF) in a Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZFW) which uses evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) for detecting algorithmically generated malicious domains names.

This security threat implies that an attacker could launch a background process on the mobile device and send the motion sensor readings to a third party vendor for further analysis. Even though the location inference is a non-trivial task requiring machine learning algorithms in order to predict the tap location, previous research was able to show that PINs and passwords of users could be successfully obtained. However, as the tap location inference was only shown for taps generated in a controlled setting not reflecting the environment users naturally engage with their smartphones, the attempts in this paper bridge this gap. We propose TapSensing, a data acquisition system designed to collect touch screen tap event information with corresponding accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Having performed a data acquisition study with 27 participants and 3 different iPhone models, a total of 25,000 labeled taps could be acquired from a laboratory and field environment enabling a direct comparison of both settings. The overall findings show that tap location inference is generally possible for data acquired in the field, hence, with a performance reduction of approximately 20% when comparing both environments. As the tap inference has therefore been shown for a more realistic data set, this work shows that smartphone motion sensors could potentially be used to comprise the user's privacy in any surrounding user's interact with the devices.

Such systems, while achieving the state-of-the-art performance on clean data, perform abnormally on inputs with predefined triggers. Current backdoor techniques, however, rely on uniform trigger patterns, which are easily detected and mitigated by current defense methods. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack technique in which the triggers vary from input to input. To achieve this goal, we implement an input-aware trigger generator driven by diversity loss. A novel cross-trigger test is applied to enforce trigger nonreusablity, making backdoor verification impossible. Experiments show that our method is efficient in various attack scenarios as well as multiple datasets. We further demonstrate that our backdoor can bypass the state of the art defense methods. An analysis with a famous neural network inspector again proves the stealthiness of the proposed attack. Our code is publicly available.

Chaos coordinated neural key synchronization for enhancing security of IoT	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hyperchaotic; Neural coordination; Complex anti-coordination (CAC); Chaotic; Session key	AUTHENTICATION; PROTOCOL	The key exchange mechanism in this paper is built utilizing neural network coordination and a hyperchaotic (or chaotic) nonlinear dynamic complex system. This approach is used to send and receive sensitive data between Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes across a public network. Using phishing, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), or spoofing attacks, an attacker can easily target sensitive information during the exchange process. Furthermore, minimal research has been made on the exchange of input seed values for creating identical input at both ends of neural networks. The proposed method uses a 5D hyperchaotic or chaotic nonlinear complex structure to ensure the sharing of input seed value across two neural networks, resulting in the identical input on both ends. This study discusses two ways for sharing seed values for neural coordination. The first is a chaotic system with all real variables, whereas the second is a hyperchaotic system with at least one complex variable. Each neural network has its own random weight vector, and the outputs are exchanged. It achieves full coordination in some stages by altering the neuronal weights according to the mutual learning law. The coordinated weights are utilized as a key after the neural coordination technique. The network's core structure is made up of triple concealed layers. So, determining the inner configuration will be tough for the intruder. The efficiency of the suggested model is validated by simulations, and the findings reveal that the suggested strategy outperforms current equivalent techniques.

Development of a Scale to Measure Perceived Persuasiveness and Two Studies Showing the Use of the Scale	FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						perceived persuasiveness; scale development; behavior change; message type; argumentation schemes		In this paper, we develop and validate a scale tomeasure the perceived persuasiveness of messages to be used in digital behavior interventions. A literature review is conducted to inspire the initial scale items. The scale is developed using Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the data from a study with 249 ratings of healthy eating messages. The construct validity of the scale is established using ratings of 573 email security messages. Using the data from the two studies, we also show the usefulness of the scale by analyzing the perceived persuasiveness of different message types on the developed scale factors in both the healthy eating and email security domains. The results of our studies also show that the persuasiveness of message types is domain dependent and that when studying the persuasiveness of message types, the finer-grained argumentation schemes need to be considered and not just Cialdini's principles.

Secure SHell session (SSH) is a popular access method, but its login information leakage presents a substantial security threat, allowing attackers to exploit identities of users and disrupt systems. As a result, security remains paramount in cloud-system operations. Access control, a vital security mechanism in operating systems, is increasingly challenging due to the complexity of control mechanisms and the difficulty in developing precise Access Control Lists (ACLs). Traditional ACLs require extensive resources for each user or role, falter in complex scenarios, and risk system vulnerability by granting excessive privileges. To address these issues, this paper introduces eBPF-based Guarded Box (eGBox), a novel solution that combines a lightweight system call restriction system with machine learning. eGBox utilizes rule learning through itemset mining to analyze user behavior and generate system call control lists, thereby significantly reducing system vulnerability. By employing extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) program hooks, eGBox effectively audits and restricts remote user behavior at the system call level. The results demonstrate that eGBox's rule-mining algorithm achieves over 99% accuracy in generating access control policies, using only 40% of the log entries for mining. Additionally, eGBox presents a lower overhead compared to established tools, such as AppArmor, thereby enhancing the overall security of the operating system.

Al has been used to generate cyber attack plans since 2005, albeit for defensive purposes. This paper reports on work in progress aimed at developing a set of Al planning operators for generating attack plans for offensive cyber operations (000). The ultimate research goal is to develop an operator-set for the complete attack process, including foot-printing, reconnaissance, planning, target access, penetration, payload delivery, and after action review, that complies with the legal requirement to minimize collateral damage. The development of planning operators is greatly aided by first creating a formal ontology of the objects and relationships in the planning domain. There is a substantial literature on cyber attack ontologies. This literature was surveyed, showing that most ontologies are intended to help defenders classify incoming attacks. Consequently, they cover only the penetration and payload delivery phases of an attack, with the vulnerabilities exploited, attack goals, and effects being only represented in abstract terms. Only one ontology was found which modelled an attacker planning an attack. While classes representing ethical, legal, military, and physical constraints were included in the ontology, collateral effects were not represented. Accordingly, two supplementary literature surveys were done, one on ontologies for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR), and the other on means for controlling collateral damage in OCO. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of surveying the literature on cyber attack ontologies, on ontologies for ISTAR, and on means for controlling collateral damage in OCO. The three literature surveys are described. The results show that there is a need to construct an ontology for cyber ISTAR and to detail payload delivery and execution in existing cyber attack ontologies. The requirements for such an ontology are outlined.

To bolster preparedness against potential attacks, organizations commonly conduct red teaming exercises, which involve simulated attacks to assess existing security measures. This paper proposes a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate ransomware attacks. By training an RL agent in a simulated environment mirroring real-world networks, effective attack strategies can be learned quickly, significantly streamlining traditional, manual penetration testing processes. The attack pathways revealed by the RL agent can provide valuable insights to the defense team, helping them identify network weak points and develop more resilient defensive measures. Experimental results on a 152-host example network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the RL agent's capability to discover and orchestrate attacks on high-value targets while evading honeyfiles (decoy files strategically placed to detect unauthorized access).

Due to hectic schedules and daily struggles, time is limited for parents. For that reason, the AI-powered child protection system helps protect children from modern cyber-attacks while offering parents more control over their children. Keyloggers, keystroke and mouse movement loggers help to collect data and can record user behaviour and find patterns. Furthermore, the use of those records is able to detect children's improper behaviour and reveal children's emotional states. Behavioral Data Extractor and Risk Analysis systems can analyze huge numbers of URLs and web content recorded by proxy, as well as application usage and screen times collected by background service. The Smart Resource Restricter is designed to help parents and children navigate the web safely and appropriately. The research can identify and prevent child predators. Indeed, cyberbullying and phishing attacks cross many boundaries, causing great harm to the community. It blocks outside threats and notifies parents of sexual and other online predators that often target children. The PandaGuardian successfully achieved its goal with the assistance of different algorithms and the respective outcomes. The model evaluation report, which compares all the methods, is a guardian companion. Parents could get assistance in order to safeguard their children from the day-to-day evolving cyber threats.

Real-time detection of insider attacks on substation automation systems using short length orthogonal wavelet filters and OPAL-RT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cyberattack; Data-injection attack; Insider attack; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); OPAL-RT; Situational awareness; Substation Automation System (SAS); Wavelet transform	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM; CYBER-ATTACK; ANOMALY DETECTION	Substation Automation Systems (SASs) integrate communication networks with physical equipment and are vulnerable to cyberattacks. A subset of these attacks, namely Insider attacks, are launched from knowledgeable insiders and therefore they are typically difficult to detect. This paper presents a new method for detecting and classifying Insider cyberattacks as well as power disturbances on SASs using short-length orthogonal wavelet filters in real-time using an OPAL-Real-Time (OPAL-RT) simulator. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed in which custom-designed wavelet filters of short length are developed to better extract both the network and physical data of the SASs into time-frequency spectrograms. The advantage of using the short length filters is to provide fast detection of these time-sensitive Insider attacks and disturbances in real-time, which is a key requirement for mitigation to be possible. The generated spectrograms are fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that automates the classification process. An experimental dataset is developed from real-time testing using OPAL-RT that implements several types of cyberattacks including Insider attacks and other popular attacks such as Denial-of-Service and False Data Injection as well as challenging attacks such as Replay and Message Suppression attacks. The results of experimentally testing the proposed method in real-time using OPAL-RT demonstrate that the use of the short-length custom-designed orthogonal wavelet filters achieves a detection accuracy of 97.37 % compared to other methods as well as a low runtime of 33.786 ms.

Pedro; Ghorbani, Reza			A Cyber-Secure generalized supermodel for wind power forecasting based on deep federated learning and image processing	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Renewable energy sources; Wind energy; Forecasting; Federated learning; Convolutional neural network	SYSTEM	Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the most important operations within the economic dispatch problem to increase the performance of power and energy systems. Accordingly, this study proposes a cyber-resilient hybrid approach based on the Federated Learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) procedure for short-term wind power generation forecasting in different regions of Iran. Generalizability, data independence, forecasting for regions where no training data is available, and preserving the security and privacy of data are prominent features of the proposed method. The federated network was designed with an architecture of 9 clients to perform the training process and extract the salient features from the data associated with each region in each client via the CNN technique. Then, the generalized global supermodel is produced based on the extracted features in each client to forecast the wind power in new and unknown regions such as Mahshahr, Bojnord, and Lootak that had no training data available and had no effect on global supermodel generation. Various scenarios were developed to test the robustness of the suggested methodology. In the first scenario, wind power forecasting is performed based on the suggested technique. In this scenario, the accuracy of the generalized supermodel to forecast wind power generation in each of the Mahshahr, Bojnord, and Lootak regions is 84%, 85%, and 74%, respectively. The second scenario models the scaling attack by changing the wind speed parameters to evaluate the performance of forecasting models against the data integrity attack. In this scenario, an evaluation of the forecast results based on various performance metrics is conducted highlighting the accuracy reduction of the forecast model, due to the damage caused by cyber-attacks on the input data. In the third scenario, the detection of cyber-attack is done based on the image processing-based technique. The presented results emphasize the accurate performance and high generalizability of the cyber-resilient global supermodel in forecasting wind power in various regions of Iran.

In this work, a framework of the skeleton-based HIR-PHM under secure Edge-Fog-Cloud computing (EFCC) was proposed to manage the computation and storage resources, latency, cyber-attack, and privacy-preserving simultaneously. At the Edge, IoMT with a camera, record the human interaction as videos and sends them to the Fog, which installed a human pose estimation model, PoseNet, to convert the videos into human skeleton data. At the Cloud, a skeleton-based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network with Pairwise Adjacency Matrix (STGCN-PAM) was employed to recognize the human interaction. A Hybrid of One Time Password (OTP), Hashed Messages Authentication Code (HMAC), and symmetric cipher were employed to secure the skeleton data. The UT-Interaction dataset was used to evaluate the proposed framework. Besides, the computation performance and latency under EFCC were compared with Edge-Fog and Edge-Cloud deployments.

At the time of exchange of sensitive information, intruders can effortlessly perform sniffing, spoofing, phishing, or Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to tamper the vital information. Information needs to be secretly transmitted with high level of encryption by preserving the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity factors. Such stated requirements urge the researchers to develop a neural network-based fast and robust security protocol. A special neural network structure called Double Layer Tree Parity Machine (DLTPM) is proposed for neural synchronization. Two DLTPMs accept the common input and different weight vectors and update the weights using neural learning rules by exchanging their output. In some steps, it results in complete synchronization, and the weights of the two DLTMs become identical. These identical weights serve as a secret key. There is, however, hardly any research in the field of neural weight vector optimization using a nature-inspired algorithm for faster neural synchronization. In this article, whale optimization-based DLTPM is proposed. For faster synchronization, this proposed DLTPM model uses a whale algorithm optimized weight vector. This proposed DLTPM model is faster and has better security. This proposed technique has been passed through a series of parametric tests. The results have been compared with some recent techniques. The results of the proposed technique have shown effective and has robust potential.

J	Xue, MF; He, C; Wang, J; Liu, WQ				Xue, Mingfu; He, Can; Wang, Jian; Liu, Weiqiang			LOPA: A linear offset based poisoning attack method against adaptive fingerprint authentication system	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence security; Poisoning attacks; Adaptive biometric authentication systems; Fingerprint authentication; Template self-update	BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS; MINUTIAE; UPDATE	Biological characteristics have been widely used in various identity authentication systems. The authentication systems typically store one or several biometric templates to identify whether a claimed user is legitimate. However, since the biological characteristics of users may undergo intra-class variabilities (such as aging or injuring by accidents) as time goes by, those initial enrolled templates may be not able to match the latest characteristics of the users. Therefore, some adaptive systems have been proposed to continuously update the en-rolled templates by using collected run-time data. However, a smart attacker can leverage this self-updating procedure to drift the stored templates by constructing and submitting a set of well-designed poisoning samples. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel linear offset based poisoning attack method, named "LOPA", against the online self-update fingerprint authentication systems. By making minor linear transformation to the minutia representation matrix of a victim's fingerprint template, the proposed attack method can generate a series of poisoning samples which are then submitted to the fingerprint authentication system. In this way, the initial template stored in the system will be imperceptibly and stealthily poisoned (i.e., updated), and eventually becomes unusable. Experimental results show that the proposed LOPA method is effective, where the stored fingerprint templates have been successfully poisoned, and those target fingers are incorrectly denied by the target system after a certain time. Specifically, the performance (the average GAR of all target fingers) of the fingerprint authentication system has dropped by 42.86%. In addition, the average matching score and the average matched minutia pairs of all target fingers have both declined, which indicate the universality of the proposed poisoning attack. This work reveals a novel security threat to the fingerprint authentication systems, and can hopefully provide references for developing future countermeasures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

OntoCPS4PMS: Ontology modeling for collaborative cyber-physical threat defense in power monitoring system	SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						cyber-physical security; defense control; knowledge reasoning; ontology; power monitoring system; risk perception		Given the deep interconnection between information and physical aspects of power systems, escalating cyber-attacks pose significant threats to both grid information systems and electrical equipment. The context highlights the importance of risk perception and defense mechanisms in information and functional security for Power Monitoring System (PMS). To address this, we introduce an innovative ontology framework designed for comprehensive cyber-physical security in PMS (OntoCPS4PMS). OntoCPS4PMS identifies risks from cross-domain attacks and supports a collaborative defense strategy. It offers a multifaceted assessment method for PMS security events, considering vulnerabilities, cyber-attack impacts, and physical domain risks. Through simulated PMS attack scenarios, we validate the framework's effectiveness in dynamic cyber-physical security analysis. The results demonstrate OntoCPS4PMS's ability to trace attacks, locate affected equipment, and recommend mitigation measures, confirming its utility in enhancing PMS security and decision-making.

Initially, pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is employed to identify primary meteorological variables as input series. Second, the wind power series are smoothed by implementing complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and then all subseries are decomposed and obtained by utilizing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for the components with the highest complexity. Subsequently, hidden information related to wind speed, wind direction, and wind power series are extracted through the bidirectional temporal convolutional network (BiTCN), and the obtained information is fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) optimized by attention mechanism for prediction. Finally, the predicted values of all components are summed to derive the final prediction results. In addition, the significant advantages of the prediction model in this paper are verified by five comparison experiments. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model's one-step prediction in the January dataset are 2.1647 and 2.8456, respectively.

The impact of the aforementioned two threats on MPL operations is yet unknown, and there is no practical way to evaluate their severity. To assess the severity of the impact of physical failures and cyber-attacks on MPLs, a safety impact analysis framework based on Elman Neural Network (ENN) observers and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm is suggested. The framework discusses three common attack and failure modes: sensor hard failure that occurs suddenly, sensor soft failure that occurs gradually over time, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that prevent communication between the controller and valve. Both sensor failures and DoS attacks render the system unsafe, according to simulation data. In comparison to DoS attacks, however, sensor failures, particularly soft failures, inflict the greatest harm to the MPLs. Furthermore, sensors engaged in global control, rather than those involved in local control, need additional protection.

Illegal trespassing and border encroachment by immigrants is a huge predicament against the United States border security force and the Department of Homeland Security. It becomes insurmountable to warranty suspicious behaviour, monitoring by human operators for long periods of time, due to the massive amount of data involved. The main objective of this research is to assist the human operators, by implementing intelligent visual surveillance systems which help in detecting and tracking suspicious or unusual events in the video sequence. The visual surveillance system requires fast and robust methods of detecting and tracking moving objects. In this research, we have investigated methods for detecting and tracking objects from UAVs. Moving objects were detected using adaptive background subtraction technique successfully and these detected objects were tracked by using Lucas-Kanade optical flow tracking, Continuously Adaptive Mean-Shift tracking based techniques. The simulation results show the efficacy of these techniques in detecting and tracking moving objects in the video sequences acquired by the UAV. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Zaiarnyi, O				Zaiarnyi, Oleh			CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BUSINESS STRATEGIES OF HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH DIGITAL PATIENTS' RIGHTS: EU EXPERIENCE AND PROPOSALS FOR UKRAINE IN WARTIME	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						business strategy of a healthcare institution; challenges of the war against Ukraine; European Union; economic security; healthcare institution; cyber risks; Patient Digital Rights		The article examines the issues of cyber risk management in the business strategies of healthcare institutions operating in the European Union, in orderto ensure the digital protection of patients and reduce potential negative economic losses. The relevance of the study stems from the rapid development of digital technologies in the healthcare sector and the increasing incidence of cyber threats that compromise the confidentiality of patient data, disrupt the operations of healthcare institutions and pose significant economic risks. The purpose of the article is to study the existing approaches to cyber risk management in the business strategies of healthcare institutions in order to reduce economic losses and ensure compliance with patients' digital rights, and on this basis to formulate proposals for improving the legislation of Ukraine and medical practice, taking into account the challenges of war. The research methods employed encompass the dialectical method, analysis and synthesis techniques to examine the interrelationships between cyber threats and patients' digital rights, statistical analysis to evaluate the prevalence of cyber threats within the European Union, modelling to formulate recommendations, and a comparative legal approach to identify common and distinct approaches in the European Union and Ukrainian legislation concerning the regulation of cyber security in healthcare facilities. The study's primary findings indicate that the most prevalent cyber threats within the digital healthcare sector encompass phishing attacks, malware, disruptions to artificial intelligence algorithms, and insider threats.The European Union has adopted contemporary methodologies in the realm of cyber security, underpinned by the principles of secure design of information systems and data protection in accordance with the rule of secure processing. At the same time, as proved in the article, it is necessary to improve the legislation of Ukraine, in particular by introducing provisions on the processing of medical data in accordance with the principles of the GDPR, strengthening the influence of international ISO standards on the business strategies of healthcare institutions for managing cyber risks and overcoming the consequences of their manifestation. A number of recommendations for Ukraine are proposed, namely ensuring cyber hygiene of medical personnel, integrating data encryption and cyber incident response plans, using artificial intelligence technologies to monitor risks, and adapting European experience to Ukrainian realities. The conclusions emphasise the necessity of implementing the most effective European practices in the realm of cyber risk management within the business strategy of medical institutions in Ukraine. This approach is expected to enhance the level of cyber security, mitigate the risks of violating patients' digital rights, and ensure the economic sustainability of healthcare facilities in the context of the ongoing war against Ukraine.

It is divided into the basic data acquisition layer, the metric indexes extraction layer, the device threat assessment layer and the threat situation assessment layer. Firstly, we calculate indexes that represent degrees of host resources consumption and qualities of network from the basic running data. Next, the D-S evidence theory is used to fuse above indexes, which assesses impact on the network of each device caused by DDoS attacks. Then, on the basis of service importance principle, we calculate the weight value of each device in the network. Furthermore, the threat situation value is obtained through weighted algorithm. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed method can vividly reflect the impact of DDoS attacks on the network security threat situation.

To ensure security-of-supply, it is necessary to analyze such attacks and their underlying vulnerabilities, to develop countermeasures and improve system design. We propose ANALYSE, a machine-learning-based software suite to let learning agents autonomously find attacks in cyber-physical energy systems, consisting of the power system, ICT, and energy markets. ANALYSE is a modular, configurable, and self-documenting framework designed to find yet unknown attack types and to reproduce many known attack strategies in cyber-physical energy systems. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

In order to defend against these attacks, URL blacklisting has been widely used. However, this approach has significant weaknesses, especially from a law-enforcement point of view. In particular, the law-enforcement does not know what to do with a blacklist because it is unclear what needs to be done (e.g., shutting down a host or domain) due to the subtleties associated with the problem. In order to help the law-enforcement in dealing with blacklisted URLs, we propose a novel framework based on Machine Learning (ML) while providing the law-enforcement with probabilistic classification and interpretability of the predictions made by the interpretable model. Our probabilistic classification and interpretability measures provide a basis for law-enforcement trustworthy decision-making and remove the black-box nature of traditional ML-based approaches. Experimental results show that the framework is practical and has further potential to tackle website maliciousness.

Being able to understand and predict a device's behaviour in a network can work as the foundation of an anomaly detection framework, as devices may show abnormal activity as part of a cyber attack. The aim of this work is the construction of a predictive regression model for a device's behaviour at normal state. The behaviour of a device is presented by a quantitative response and modelled to depend on historic data recorded by NetFlow.

In many cases, pre-trained models are sourced from vendors who may have disrupted the training pipeline to insert Trojan behaviors. These malicious behaviors can be triggered at the adversary's will, which is a serious security threat. To verify the integrity of a deep model, we propose a method that captures its fingerprint with adversarial perturbations. Inserting backdoors into a network alters its decision boundaries which are effectively encoded by adversarial perturbations. Our proposed Trojan detection network learns features from adversarial patterns and its properties to encode the unknown trigger shape and deviations in the decision boundaries caused by backdoors. Our method works completely without or with limited clean samples for improved performance. Our method also performs anomaly detection to identify the target class of a Trojaned network and is invariant to the trigger type, trigger size, network architecture and does not require any triggered samples. Experiments are performed on MNIST, NIST-TrojAI and Odysseus datasets, with 5000 pre-trained models in total, making this the largest study to date on Trojaned detection and the new state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved.

HERMES: A High-Level Policy Language for High-Granularity Enterprise-wide Secure Browser Configuration Management	PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	DEC 06-09, 2016	Athens, GREECE					In this article, we describe the characteristics, structure, and uses of HERMES. HERMES is a high-level security policy description language. Its characteristics are: (1) enable the specification of organizational domain knowledge in a hierarchical manner; (2) enable the specification of security policies at desired granularity levels within the organizational IT and OT infrastructure; (3) enable security policies to be automatically instantiated into security configurations; (4) it is human-centered and designed for ease of use; (5) it is application and device independent. We show an example of using HERMES to write a high-level policy and show examples of how such policy can be instantiated into a domain and device, user and role, application and action specific security configuration. We also describe the integration of HERMES within the HiFiPol: Browser policy management system. We believe HERMES is a necessary step toward securing the client side of the web ecosystem and prevent or mitigate the current onslaught of web browser-based attacks, such as phishing.

J	Jiang, Y; Yin, GS; Yuan, Y; Da, QA				Jiang, Yan; Yin, Guisheng; Yuan, Ye; Da, Qingan			Project Gradient Descent Adversarial Attack against Multisource Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article								Deep learning technology (a deeper and optimized network structure) and remote sensing imaging (i.e., the more multisource and the more multicategory remote sensing data) have developed rapidly. Although the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing image (RSI) scene classification, the existence of adversarial attacks poses a potential security threat to the RSI scene classification task based on CNN. The corresponding adversarial samples can be generated by adding a small perturbation to the original images. Feeding the CNN-based classifier with the adversarial samples leads to the classifier misclassify with high confidence. To achieve a higher attack success rate against scene classification based on CNN, we introduce the projected gradient descent method to generate adversarial remote sensing images. Then, we select several mainstream CNN-based classifiers as the attacked models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results show that our proposed method can dramatically reduce the classification accuracy under untargeted and targeted attacks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the quality of the generated adversarial images by visual and quantitative comparisons.

A unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) is used by the AIS transceiver to identify the specific ship. However, an attacker can easily forge and tamper with unique MMSI. Also, the AIS transceiver sends the traffic information such as latitude, longitude, speed, MMSI, ship type, dimension, navigation status, etc. to the other ships and the base station continuously. This continuous communication of a ship with the base station or other ships may lead to the serious security threat of ship trajectory privacy. To overcome the above-discussed security threats, anonymous authentication with a trajectory privacy-preserving scheme is proposed. The security and performance analysis section ensures that the proposed scheme provides the necessary security features by consuming less computational and communication energy comparing to that of other competing systems.

Datasets like web logs, call records, medical records, military surveillance, photography archives, etc. are often so large and complex, and as the data is stored in Big Data in the form of both structured and unstructured therefore, big data cannot be processed using database queries like SQL queries. In big data, malicious URLs have become a station for internet criminal activities such as drive-bydownload, information warfare, spamming and phishing. Malicious URLs detection techniques can be classified into Non-Machine Learning (e.g. blacklisting) and Machine learning approach (e.g. data mining techniques). Data mining helps in the analysis of large and complex datasets in order to detect common patterns or learn new things. Big data is the collection of large and complex datasets and the processing of these datasets can be done either by using tool like Hadoop or data mining algorithms. Data mining techniques can generate classification models which is used to manage data, modelling of data that helps to make prediction about whether it is malicious or legitimate. In this paper analysis of RIPPER i.e. JRip data mining algorithm has been done using WEKA tool. A training dataset of 6000 URLs has been made to train the JRip algorithm which is an implementation of RIPPER algorithm in WEKA. Training dataset will generate a model which is used to predict the testing dataset of 1050 URLs. Accuracy are calculated after testing process. Result shows JRip has an accuracy of 82%.

Secure Shell (SSH) is one of the most popular methods for remote access, but the leakage of login information presents a substantial security threat, enabling attackers to exploit identities and disrupt systems. Consequently, ensuring robust security in cloud-system operations is paramount. Access control, a crucial security mechanism in operating systems, is becoming increasingly complex due to the intricate nature of control mechanisms and the difficulty in developing precise Access Control Lists (ACLs). Traditional ACLs require extensive resources for each user or role, struggle in complex scenarios, and risk system vulnerability by granting excessive privileges. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Extend Security boX (ESX), a novel solution that combines a lightweight system call restriction system with machine learning method. ESX utilizes rule learning through itemset mining to analyze user behavior and generate system call control lists, thereby significantly reducing system vulnerability. By employing extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) program hooks, ESX effectively audits and restricts remote user behavior at the system call level. Our results show that ESX's rule-mining algorithm achieves over 99% accuracy in generating access control policies, using only 40% of the log entries for mining. Additionally, ESX presents a lower overhead compared to established security solutions, such as AppArmor, enhancing the overall operating system security.

Dendritic Cell Algorithm for Mobile Phone Spam Filtering	6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AMBIENT SYSTEMS, NETWORKS AND TECHNOLOGIES (ANT-2015), THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SEIT-2015)	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT) / 5th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology (SEIT)	JUN 02-05, 2015	London, ENGLAND			Mobile Technology; Smartphones; Short Message Service (SMS); Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA); Spam Detection and Filtering; Application Security		With the revolution of mobile devices and their applications, significant improvements have been witnessed over years to support new features in addition to normal phone communication including web browsing, social networking and entertainment, mobile payment, medical and personal records, e-learning, and rich connectivity to multiple networks. As mobile devices continue to evolve, the volume of hacking activities targeting them also increases drastically. Receiving short message spam is one of the common vectors for security breaches. Besides wasting resources and being annoying to end-users, it can be used for phishing attacks and as a vehicle for other malware types such as worms, backdoors, and key loggers. The next generation of mobile technologies has more emphasis on security-related issues to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability. This paper explores a number of content-based feature sets to enhance the mobile phone text messaging services in filtering unwanted messages (a.k.a. spam). Moreover, it develops a more effective spam filtering model using a combination of most relevant features and by fusing decisions of two machine learning algorithms with the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). The performance has been evaluated empirically on two SMS spam datasets. The results showed that significant improvements can be achieved in the overall accuracy, recall and precision of spam and legitimate messages due to the application of the proposed DCA-based model.

Network scanning is considered necessary to identify vulnerable IoT devices connected to IP networks. However, most existing network scanning tools or system do not consider the burden of scan packet traffic on the network, especially in the IoT network where resources are limited. It is necessary to know the status of the communication environment and the reason why network scanning failed. Therefore, this paper proposes a multimodel-based approach which can be utilized to estimate the cause of failure/delay of network scanning over wireless networks where a scan packet or its response may sometimes be dropped or delayed. Specifically, the factors that cause network scanning failure/delay were identified and categorized. Then, using a machine learning algorithm, we introduced a multimodel linear discriminant analysis (MM-LDA) to estimate the cause of scan failure/delay based on the results of network scanning. In addition, a one-to-many model and a training data filtering technique were adopted to ensure that the estimation error was drastically reduced. The goal of our proposed method was to correctly estimate the causes of scan failure/delay in IP-connected devices. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using computer simulation assuming a cellular (LTE) network as the targeted IoT wireless network and using LTE-connected devices as the targeted IoT devices. The proposed MM-LDA correctly estimates the cause of failure/delay of the network scan at an average probability of 98% in various scenarios. In comparison to other conventional machine learning classifiers, the proposed MM-LDA outperforms various classification methods in the estimation of the cause of scan failure/delay.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH NETWORK TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS CONFERENCE, TMA 2024			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)	MAY 21-24, 2024	Dresden, GERMANY			Darknets; Blocklists; cybersecurity		Darknets are IP addresses that function as passive probes, recording all received packets without hosting services. The traffic they capture, being unsolicited, makes darknets akin to "network telescopes". Traces collected on darknets aggregate multiple events useful for cybersecurity, like network scans and exploit attempts. Yet, the mix of heterogeneous events observed from darknets poses significant challenges to those who must understand darknet traffic. Here we face the question of whether new darknet deployments provide novel and useful information when compared to public blocklists. Multiple Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sources publish lists of IP addresses that perform malicious activities, from simple automated scans to SPAM and phishing campaigns. They represent a valuable resource for network administrators, helping to block cyberattacks. Built with a combination of multiple sensors - including darknets and honeypots - these lists could explain the traffic seen on other darknets, thus simplifying the search for relevant events in independent darknet deployments. We thus investigate to what extent open blocklists explain darknet traffic. By crawling hundreds of CTI sources providing blocklists, we first notice how these lists are often incomplete or slowly updated. Traffic seen in our darknet deployment is hardly explained by the blocklists, even when considering only the most prominent scan attempts, and ignoring events such as backscattering. Our preliminary results suggest that blocklists can be of great use for seeding the explanation of darknet traffic, by giving context for the activity of a few IP addresses. Yet, more addresses with similar behaviour are observed in the darknet and could be used to enrich and complement the blocklists.

So far, various schemes have been selected for DLR forecasting that offers acceptable capacity but require measuring instruments and communication networks with precise calibration on the conductor surface, which in addition to high economic costs, are always available for cyber attackers. In this study, to forecast the DLR values, a deep learning-based technique called long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed. Additionally, a novel data integrity attack detection approach based on image processing is developed to maintain the performance of the forecasting model against cyber-attacks. The LSTM forecasts the DLR values of an overhead transmission line located in Tabriz, Iran, using meteorological parameters as input data. The forecasting results confirm the high performance of the LSTM model with minimal error values. Then, a scaling attack is applied as a known data integrity attack on the input variables of wind speed and wind direction to evaluate the performance of the LSTM network against cyber-attacks. The results of this scenario show that a cyber-attack can significantly reduce the accuracy of the forecasting. To prevent this, the image processing-based technique detects and clearly displays the cyber-attacks in each of the input variables by converting the input data parameters to 2-D images.

The change is complicated by technological developments such as deploying machine learning based autonomous space systems and the Internet of Space Things (IoST). In the IoST, space systems will rely on satellite-to-x communication and interactions with wider aspects of the ground segment to a greater degree than existing systems. Such developments will inevitably lead to a change in the cyber security threat landscape of space systems. Inevitably, there will be a greater number of attack vectors for adversaries to exploit, and previously infeasible threats can be realised, and thus require mitigation. In this paper, we present a reference architecture (RA) that can be used to abstractly model in situ applications of this new space landscape. The RA specifies high-level system components and their interactions. By instantiating the RA for two scenarios we demonstrate how to analyse the attack surface using attack trees.

This security threat to machine learning has been a long concern. There are a number of defense techniques proposed by the community. Do they work for a large spectrum of attacks? As we argue that they are significant and prevalent in contemporary research, and we conduct a systematic study on 14 attacks and 12 defenses. Our empirical results show that existing defenses often fail on certain attacks. To understand the reason, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks through theoretical analysis. Particularly, we formulate backdoor poisoning as a continual learning task, and introduce two key properties: orthogonality and linearity. These two characteristics in-depth explain how backdoors are learned by models from a theoretical perspective. This helps to understand the reason behind the failure of various defense techniques. Through our study, we highlight open challenges in defending against backdoor attacks and provide future directions.

Despite the fact that security improvements in IPv6 are notable, meanwhile "black hat" experts launch their continuous threats against business network and banking systems to damage the network service development. In order to mitigate such security threat, we need to understand the infrastructure and the underlining mechanism. In this paper, we examine the traffic signatures of different denial of service (Dos) attacks that affect IPv6 protocol by using packet analyzer tools in collaboration with a popular IPv6 security assessment tool and traffic correlational values to establish the similarities and difference between various Dos attack traffic signatures (i.e. uniqueness). The level of uniqueness of the attack traffic signatures is used to determine whether a correlational-based intrusion detection technique is suitable for mitigating Dos attacks in IPv6. A comprehensive table of all simulated Dos attacks is illustrated to present the observations and inferences drawn from the assessments achieved through two different operating system platforms (Windows and Linux). This new analysis approach is added to many pre-existing works carried out to investigate the security of IPv6 protocol.

But how predictable are cyber-attacks? Researchers have attempted to combine external data ranging from vulnerability disclosures to discussions on Twitter and the darkweb - with machine learning algorithms to learn indicators of impending cyber-attacks. However, successful cyber-attacks represent a tiny fraction of all attempted attacks: the vast majority are stopped, or filtered by the security appliances deployed at the target. As we show in this paper, the process of filtering reduces the predictability of cyber-attacks. The small number of attacks that do penetrate the target's defenses follow a different generative process compared to the whole data which is much harder to learn for predictive models. This could be caused by the fact that the resulting time series also depends on the filtering process in addition to all the different factors that the original time series depended on. We empirically quantify the loss of predictability due to filtering using real-world data from two organizations. Our work identifies the limits to forecasting cyber-attacks from highly filtered data.

However, these attacks are bounded by multiple nonlinear constraints that provide different temporal features in the bad data that existing FDI detectors might fail to identify. In this article, a cyberattack model using stealthy FDIs on load or generation units is formulated that may result in multiple transmission line overflows without being detected by bad data detection (BDD) algorithms embedded in ac state-estimation. A detection framework based on neural networks is developed that uses bad data generated from the attack model for training purposes and detects the stealthy FDIs. Results confirm the detection of stealthy FDIs with accuracy and precision higher than 99% with 0-15% measurement noise levels. The developed detection framework outperforms existing BDD algorithms of ac state-estimators.

Yet, the deeply intertwined information and communication technologies have exposed smart city management to malicious cyberattacks vastly. This study develops a two-stage mitigation strategy for integrated transportation-energy systems (TESs) by coordinating energy and transportation systems to safeguard against false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Our strategy targets social engagements by electric vehicle (EV) users who can be incentivized to alter their regular EV usage patterns for supporting the energy system via vehicle-to-grid actions. We consider a TES that contains a multi-energy system comprised of power and gas systems as well as an urban transportation system. Integrated system operators can take emergency measures to coordinate important system assets (e.g., traditional generators, renewable generators, EV fleets) in a sensible and intelligent way, and thereby mitigate the consequences of FDIAs. Specifically, we take a two-stage distributionally robust approach to cope with uncertain FDIAs, with which a moment-based ambiguity set is employed to yield the worst-case uncertainty distribution. We leverage constraint generation-based relaxation to solve the problem iteratively. To demonstrate our strategy's value and practical utilities, we use a coupled urban TES to conduct case studies. According to the evaluation results, the optimized EV scheduling and energy dispatch scheme produced by the proposed strategy can contain cyberattacks' impacts and enhance cyber resilience in smart city management more effectively.

Improved discrete salp swarm algorithm using exploration and exploitation techniques for feature selection in intrusion detection systems	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Feature selection problem; Variable neighborhood search; Salp swarm algorithm; Opposition-based learning; Elite opposition-based learning; Intrusion detection datasets; Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Sigmoid function	CUCKOO SEARCH; OPTIMIZER	The salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a well-known optimization algorithm that is increasingly being utilized to solve many sorts of optimization problems. However, SSA may converge to sub-optimal solutions when it is applied to discrete problems such as the feature selection (FS) problem. This paper presents the enhanced opposition-based learning salp swarm algorithm (EOSSA), which is an improved SSA algorithm for solving the FS problem in intrusion detection systems (IDS). EOSSA incorporates four improvements into the original SSA algorithm. Firstly, the opposition-based learning (OBL) method is used in the initialization step of SSA to boost its population diversity. Secondly, the Elite opposition-based learning (EOBL) is used in the improvement loop of SSA to improve its exploration ability. Third, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) method is used in the improvement loop of SSA to improve its exploration mechanism to improve the local search space. Lastly, the Sigmoid binary transform function is used to convert the continuous candidate solutions produced by SSA into discrete binary solutions. EOSSA was evaluated against eighteen popular optimization algorithms (e.g., improved salp swarm algorithm based on opposition-based learning (ISSA), SSA, particle swarm algorithm (PSO), cuckoo search (CS), bat algorithm (BA), and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO)) using eleven popular intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICDDOS2019, CIRA-CIC-DoH, Intrusion detection 2018, UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, Phishing Legitimate, Malmem2022, IoT, and LUFlow Network) to Detect IoT Botnet Attacks. Moreover, EOSSA was compared with four machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)). The overall simulation results suggested that the proposed method is superior to the other algorithms in terms of the accuracy and number of selected features. The statistical analysis of the simulation results using the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirms the superiority of the proposed method.

People use social media for socializing and collecting and sharing information, which presumes online social media is always reliable. However, there are a lot of advertisements or cyberattacks that take advantage of the impact of online social media. For example, spam, phishing, and advertising through influence manipulation. They are not only directly damaging users, but they are also giving indirect damages that will cause damage to the credibility of online social media to decline. We (1) propose measurements for online social status to identify the attackers in online social media and (2) analyze the difference in the manner in which a normal user and an attacker make a neighbor relationship.

In this paper, we leverage recent advances in tree kernels to solve real problems. As an example, we apply our method to the problem of detecting fake e-commerce sites. Although the problem is similar to phishing site detection, the fact that mimicking existing authentic sites is harmful for fake e-commerce sites marks a clear difference between these two problems. We focus on fake e-commerce site detection for three reasons: e-commerce fraud is a real problem that companies and law enforcement have been cooperating to solve; Inefficiency hampers existing approaches because datasets tend to be large, while subpath kernel learning overcomes these performance challenges; And we offer increased resiliency against attempts to subvert existing detection methods through incorporating robust features that adversaries cannot change: the DOM-trees of web-sites. Our real-world results are remarkable: our method has exhibited accuracy as high as 0.998 when training SVM with 1000 instances and evaluating accuracy for almost 7000 independent instances. Its generalization efficiency is also excellent: with only 100 training instances, the accuracy score reached 0.996.

Victim models can maintain competitive performance on clean samples while behaving abnormally on samples with a specific trigger word inserted. Previous backdoor attacking methods usually assume that attackers have a certain degree of data knowledge, either the dataset which users would use or proxy datasets for a similar task, for implementing the data poisoning procedure. However, in this paper, we find that it is possible to hack the model in a data-free way by modifying one single word embedding vector, with almost no accuracy sacrificed on clean samples. Experimental results on sentiment analysis and sentence-pair classification tasks show that our method is more efficient and stealthier. We hope this work can raise the awareness of such a critical security risk hidden in the embedding layers of NLP models. Our code is available at https://github.com/1ancopku/Embedding-Poisoning.

The proposed method includes three stages, at which the analysis of the self-similarity property for the reference traffic is performed (using the Dickey-Fuller test, R/S analysis and the DFA method), the analysis of the self-similarity property for real traffic (by the same methods) and additional processing of time series with statistical methods (moving average, Z-Score and CUSUM methods). The issues of software implementation of the proposed method and the formation of a data set containing network packets are considered. The experimental results demonstrated the presence of self-similarity in network traffic and confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed method. The method allows detecting cyber attacks in real or near real time and ensures high survivability of the embedded computer network.

These guidelines are inadequate, outdated, and provide little protection for consumers. Moreover, there are many techniques to anonymize the stored data that was collected by large companies and governments. However, what does not exist is a framework that is capable of evaluating and scoring the effects of this information in the event of a data breach. In this work, a framework for scoring and evaluating the vulnerability of private data is presented. This framework is created to be used in parallel with currently adopted frameworks that are used to score and evaluate other areas of deficiencies within the software, including CVSS and CWSS. It is dubbed the Privacy Assessment Vulnerability Scoring System (PAVSS) and quantifies the privacy-breach vulnerability an individual takes on when using an online platform. This framework is based on a set of hypotheses about user behavior, inherent properties of an online platform, and the usefulness of available data in performing a cyber attack. The weight each of these metrics has within our model is determined by surveying cybersecurity experts. Finally, we test the validity of our user-behavior based hypotheses, and indirectly our model by analyzing user posts from a large twitter data set.

Interval forecasting of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, AUTOMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEMS 2017	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering, Automation and Control Systems (MEACS)	DEC 04-06, 2017	Tomsk, RUSSIA					At present, cyber-security issues of industrial control systems occupy one of the key niches in a state system of planning and management Functional disruption of these systems via cyber-attacks may lead to emergencies related to loss of life, environmental disasters, major financial and economic damage, or disrupted activities of cities and settlements. There is then an urgent need to develop protection methods against cyber-attacks. This paper studied the results of cyber-attack interval forecasting with a pre-set intensity level of cyber-attacks. Interval forecasting is the forecasting of one interval from two predetermined ones in which a future value of the indicator will be obtained. For this, probability estimates of these events were used. For interval forecasting, a probabilistic neural network with a dynamic updating value of the smoothing parameter was used. A dividing bound of these intervals was determined by a calculation method based on statistical characteristics of the indicator. The number of cyber-attacks per hour that were received through a honeypot from March to September 2013 for the group 'zeppo-norcal' was selected as the indicator.	[Ivanyo, Y.

A Nature-inspired Decision System for Secure Cyber Network Architecture	2017 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 27-DEC 01, 2017	Honolulu, HI					Cyber security experts have recommended splitting a computer network into multiple segments to limit the damage that an attacker can cause after penetrating the network. However, there is no clear guidance on what segmentation architectures are best to maximize a network's security posture. Furthermore, modern networks are complex and vary widely from organization to organization and, thus, there exists no single "best" architecture that will maximize security for all network environments. Hence, security practitioners rely on judgment to determine which architecture is best for their network. This paper proposes a cyber decision support system that automatically generates security-optimized segmentation architectures for network environments subject to dynamically-changing cyber threats. The system employs a hybrid approach that combines nature-inspired optimization methods with simulation modeling to construct and evaluate candidate architectures, intelligently search the space of possible architectures, and adapt to changing threat levels. We demonstrate the system via a case study on a representative network environment under an evolving cyber attack.

These security risks can leave users vulnerable to many different malicious attacks. In this paper, recent hacking events are analyzed and categorized to understand the intention behind them and how they occurred. These attacks can range from code manipulation, phishing, software attacks, to LOT (Internet of Things) vulnerabilities and more. Such attacks can be used to cause great damage including making businesses lose money, lose trust from customers and the public about their products, etc. The analysis of recent hacking events shows how companies and other users are targeted and attacked, and the emerging trend of the attacks.

Given the agility of attackers, the scale of the Internet, and the fast-evolving landscape of threats, one could not rely solely on a single source (such as an anti-malware engine or an IP blacklist) for obtaining accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive threat analysis. Instead, we need to aggregate the analysis from multiple sources. However, it is non-trivial to do such aggregation effectively. A common practice is to label an indicator (malware, domains, URLs, etc.) as malicious if it is marked by a number of sources above an ad-hoc certain threshold. Often, this results in sub-optimal performance as it assumes that all sources are of similar quality/expertise, independent, and temporally stable, which unfortunately are often not true in practice. A natural alternative is to train a supervised machine learning model. However, this approach needs a sufficiently large amount of manually labeled ground truth, which is time-consuming to collect and has to be updated frequently, resulting in substantial recurring costs. In this paper, we propose SIRAJ, a novel framework for aggregating the detection output of various intelligence sources such as anti-malware engines. SIRAJ is based on the pretrain and fine-tune paradigm. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning-based approaches to learn a pre-trained embedding model that converts multi-source inputs into a high-dimensional embedding. The embeddings are learned through three carefully designed pretext tasks that imbue them with knowledge about dependencies between scanners and their temporal dynamics. The learned embeddings could be used for diverse downstream machine learning tasks. SIRAJ is designed to be general and can be used for diverse domains such as URLs, malware, and IPs. Further, SIRAJ works well even when there is limited to no labeled data available. Through extensive experiments, we show that our learned representations can produce results comparable to supervised methods while only requiring as little as 100 labeled samples. Importantly, the results show that SIRAJ accurately detects threat indicators much earlier than the baseline algorithms, a feat that is critical against short-lived indicators like Phishing URLs.

J	Tang, DG; Fang, YP; Zio, E				Tang, Daogui; Fang, Yi-Ping; Zio, Enrico			Vulnerability analysis of demand-response with renewable energy integration in smart grids to cyber attacks and online detection methods	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Smart grids; Distributed renewable energy resources; Demand-response; Cyber attacks detector; Convolutional neural network	ELECTRICITY THEFT; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; MODELS; PV; GAME	The two-way information exchange between customers and the utility in smart grids enables demand-response programs of customers and the integration of distributed renewable energy resources. However, this also makes the demand-response programs vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we study cyber attacks that target customers' demand-response programs in smart grids by injecting false consumption and generation information. Then, as a countermeasure, an online detector based on convolutional neural networks is designed to detect the cyber attacks and mitigate impacts. The vulnerability of power distribution systems with and without the proposed detector is analyzed with reference to a case study concerning the IEEE 34 bus test feeder. The results show that the power distribution systems is vulnerable to the studied cyber attack and the proposed detector can achieve high accuracy and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks with fixed change rates, whereas the attacks with variable change rates are inherently challenging to detect.

The web3 scams, imitating the services provided by legitimate platforms, mimic regular activity to deceive users. The current phishing account detection tools utilize graph learning or sampling algorithms to obtain graph features. However, large-scale transaction networks with temporal attributes conform to a power-law distribution, posing challenges in detecting web3 scams. In this paper, we present ScamSweeper, a novel framework to identify web3 scams on Ethereum. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale transaction dataset consisting of web3 scams, phishing, and normal accounts. Our experiments indicate that ScamSweeper exceeds the state-of-the-art in detecting web3 scams.

Processing billions of dollars per day, many financial institutions, need to continuously fight organized crime in the form of transaction fraud, stolen cards, anti-money laundering, account opening fraud, impersonations scams, phishing, and many other exotic and ever changing attacks from organized crime groups worldwide. In fact, it is estimated that in 2023 the global losses in fraud scams and bank fraud reached $485.6 billion. However, in addition to having very good detection rates and very low false positive rates, financial institutions also need to maintain very high availability rates, very low latencies, very high throughputs, automatic fault tolerance, auto scale up and down, and more. In this talk we cover some lessons related to running ML models in harsh, mission critical environments. We describe data issues, scale issues, ethical issues, system issues, security issues, compliance issues, business and regulation issues, and some architectural tradeoffs and architectural evolutions.

This raises the needs to incorporate new features for detecting novel phish websites and optimizing the existing anti-phishing techniques. In this light, 58 new hybrid features were proposed in this paper and their prediction susceptibilities were evaluated by using feature co-occurrence criterion and a baseline machine learning algorithm. Empirical test and analysis showed the significant outcomes of the proposed features on detection performance. As a result, the most influential features are identified, and new insights are offered for further detection improvement.

This lack of research due to a multitude of challenges has resulted in absence of knowledge base and resources to facilitate such an investigation. Digitalization in the form of smart grids is upon us but in case of cyber-attacks, attribution to such attacks is challenging and difficult if not impossible. In this research, we have identified digital forensic artifacts resulting from a cyber-attack on Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) systems, which will help an investigator attribute an attack using the identified evidences. The research also shows the usage of sandboxing for digital forensics along with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup. This is first of its kind effort to identify and acquire all the digital forensic evidences for WAMPAC systems which will ultimately help in building a body of knowledge and taxonomy for power system forensics.

However, it is observed that DNN based systems are easily deceived by adversarial examples leading to wrong predictions. Adversarial examples, which are generated by adding purposeful perturbations on natural examples, pose a serious security threat. In this study, we propose the adversarial separation network (AS-Net) to protect the speaker recognition system against adversarial attacks. Our proposed AS-Net is featured by its ability to separate adversarial perturbation from the test speech to restore the natural clean speech. As a standalone component, each input speech is pre-processed by AS-Net first. Furthermore, we incorporate the compression structure and the speaker quality loss to enhance the capacity of the AS-Net. Experimental results on the VCTK dataset demonstrated that the AS-Net effectively enhanced the robustness of speaker recognition systems against adversarial examples. It also significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art adversarial-detection mechanisms, including adversarial perturbation elimination network (APE-GAN), feature squeezing, and adversarial training.

The identification of legal satellite emitters is important to enhance the security of satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised specific emitter identification (SEI) method based on feature parameter fusion and adaptive clustering. We designed a feature extractor which fuses diverse feature parameter extraction methods. Then, an adaptive clustering algorithm is introduced to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in non-cooperative communication scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised SEI in terms of recognition accuracy.

Existing attacks are often not evasive to established backdoor detection techniques. This susceptibility primarily stems from the fact that these attacks typically leverage a universal trigger pattern or transformation function, such that the trigger can cause misclassification for any input. In response to this, recent papers have introduced attacks using sample-specific invisible triggers crafted through special transformation functions. While these approaches manage to evade detection to some extent, they reveal vulnerability to existing backdoor mitigation techniques. To address and enhance both evasiveness and resilience, we introduce a novel backdoor attack LOTUS. Specifically, it leverages a secret function to separate samples in the victim class into a set of partitions and applies unique triggers to different partitions. Furthermore, LOTUS incorporates an effective trigger focusing mechanism, ensuring only the trigger corresponding to the partition can induce the backdoor behavior. Extensive experimental results show that LOTUS can achieve high attack success rate across 4 datasets and 7 model structures, and effectively evading 13 backdoor detection and mitigation techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/Megum1/LOTUS.

This simultaneously addresses two major concerns in relevant applications, which are typically handled separately in the existing works. An image approximation-based data storage scheme to improve the efficiency of memory usage while reducing energy consumption at both the source and user ends is discussed. Also, the proposed framework mitigates the impacts of two different adversarial attacks, notably retaining performance. The experimental analysis signifies the academic and industrial importance of this work as it demonstrates reductions of 62.5% in energy consumption for image classification when accessing memory and in the effective memory sizes of both ends by the same amount. During the improvement of memory efficiency, the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) is found to be the optimum image quality assessment method among different similarity-based metrics for the image classification task with approximated images and an average image quality of 0.9449 in terms of MS-SSIM is maintained. Also, a comparative analysis of three different classifiers with different depths indicates that the proposed scheme maintains up to 90.17% of original classification accuracy under normal and cyber-attack scenarios, effectively defending against untargeted and targeted white-box adversarial attacks with varying parameters.

Due to the resource constraints and open nature of IoT nodes, the routing protocol for low power and lossy (RPL) networks may be vulnerable to several routing attacks. That's why a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is needed to guard against routing assaults on RPL-based IoT networks. The imbalance between the false and valid attacks in the training set degrades the performance of machine learning employed to detect network attacks. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel approach to balance the dataset classes based on metaheuristic optimization applied to locality-sensitive hashing and synthetic minority oversampling technique (LSH-SMOTE). The proposed optimiza-tion approach is based on a new hybrid between the grey wolf and dipper throated optimization algorithms. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a set of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of NIDS for three cases, namely, detection without dataset balancing, detection with SMOTE balancing, and detection with the proposed optimized LSH-SOMTE balancing. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperforms the other approaches and could boost the detection accuracy. In addition, a statistical analysis is performed to study the significance and stability of the proposed approach. The conducted experiments include seven different types of attack cases in the RPL-NIDS17 dataset. Based on the proposed approach, the achieved accuracy is (98.1%), sensitivity is (97.8%), and specificity is (98.8%).

J	Wang, MY; Wu, P; Luo, Q				Wang, Maoyang; Wu, Peng; Luo, Qin			Construction of Software Supply Chain Threat Portrait Based on Chain Perspective	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						software supply chain; software supply chain threat model; attack technique matrix; software supply chain portrait		With the rapid growth of the software industry, the software supply chain (SSC) has become the most intricate system in the complete software life cycle, and the security threat situation is becoming increasingly severe. For the description of the SSC, the relevant research mainly focuses on the perspective of developers, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the SSC. This paper proposes a chain portrait framework of the SSC based on a resource perspective, which comprehensively depicts the threat model and threat surface indicator system of the SSC. The portrait model includes an SSC threat model and an SSC threat indicator matrix. The threat model has 3 levels and 32 dimensions and is based on a generative artificial intelligence model. The threat indicator matrix is constructed using the Attack Net model comprising 14-dimensional attack strategies and 113-dimensional attack techniques. The proposed portrait model's effectiveness is verified through existing SSC security events, domain experts, and event visualization based on security analysis models.

Ant colony optimization edge selection for support vector machine speed optimization	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Support vector machine; Instance selection; Speed optimization; Ant colony optimization	INSTANCE SELECTION; PROTOTYPE SELECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DATA REDUCTION; NEAREST; CLASSIFICATION; SEARCH; RULE; INTELLIGENCE; SUBSET	Support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used and reliable machine learning algorithm. It has been successfully applied to many real-world problems, with remarkable results. However, it has also been observed that SVM computational complexity increases with the increase in data size. Although many SVM speed optimization techniques have been proposed in the literature, there is still need for further improvement on the performance speed and accuracy of this algorithm. In this paper, a boundary detection algorithm for SVM speed optimization called ant colony optimization instance selection algorithm (ACOISA) is proposed. ACOISA is inspired by edge selection in ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, and it performs two primary functions: boundary detection and boundary instance selection. In the algorithm, ACO is used for boundary detection and k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used for boundary instance selection. Different sets of experiments are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique. All the experiments were performed on 35 datasets containing three well-known e-fraud types (credit card fraud, email spam and phishing email) and 31 other datasets available at UCI data repository. The experimental results showed that the proposed technique efficiently improved SVM training speed in 100% of the datasets used for evaluation, without significantly affecting SVM classification quality. Furthermore, the Freidman's and Holm's post hoc tests were conducted to statistically validate the credibility of the results. The statistical test results revealed that the proposed technique is significantly faster, compared to the standard SVM and some existing instance selection techniques, in all cases.

A malicious attacker can create a link between the customized trigger and the targeted label, such that the prediction of the poisoned model will be manipulated if the input contains the predetermined trigger. However, most existing backdoor attacks define an obvious trigger (eg: conspicuous pigment block) and need to modify the poisoned images' label, causing these images seems to be labeled incorrectly, which leads to these images can not pass human inspection. In addition, the design of the trigger always needs the information of the entire training data set, an extremely stringent experiment setting. These settings above remarkably restrict the practicality of backdoor attacks in the real world. In our paper, the proposed algorithm effectively solves these restrictions of existing backdoor attack. Our Label-Specific backdoor attack can design a unique trigger for each label, while just accessing the images of the target label. The victim model trained on our poisoned training dataset will maliciously output attacker-manipulated predictions while the poisoned model is activated by the trigger. Meanwhile victim model still maintains a good performance confronting benign data samples. Hence, our proposed backdoor attack approach must be more practical.

C	Chen, LY			IEEE	Chen, Liangyuan			A Multimodal Biometric Recognition System Based on Finger Snapping and Information Fusion	2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCE, COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSPORTATION (ISCTT 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Information Science, Computer Technology and Transportation (ISCTT)	NOV 13-15, 2020	Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA			Biometric Recognition; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Feature Engineering; Autoencoders; Convolutional Neural Networks; Time Sequence Analysis		Biometrics, physiological and/or behavioral traits used to distinguish different individuals, have now been widely used in authentication sites because they have shown advantage over passwords and token-based verification methods. However, biometric systems that use static and unimodal biometric information are susceptible to spoofing, which poses a security threat. Finger snapping, which is dynamic and can be collected multimodally, has the potential to overcome the current challenges, but a good information fusion method, model, as well as dataset is needed. In this study, three main questions are proposed and studied: (1) Is snapping a viable biometric? (2) Is feature-level information fusion of snapping practical? (3) How do traditional ML models and DL models differ in their performances on a snapping dataset? To answer the three questions, a preparative dataset consisting of kinetic information of snaps from 33 participants, as well as a main dataset consisting of kinetic and acoustic information of snaps from 50 participants have been built using a self-constructed data collection system. The preparative dataset is used to decide which subset of sensors provides the most useful information, and the main dataset is used to answer the above three questions. After testing, it is discovered that (1) snapping is a highly feasible biometric, (2) the kinetic and acoustic data can be fused at the feature level, and (3) The traditional ML model tested has greater potential over DL models due to the higher AUROC metric (0.967 0.034 versus 0.943 0.032), but has a lower weighted accuracy score with the default decision threshold than the DL model (87.5% 4.04% versus 89.9% 2.74%).

They are generally distributed across the world wide web under various usage categories like spam, malware, phishing, etc. Although numerous methods or fixes (to identify URLs) have been developed in recent years, still cyberattacks continue to occur. This study contributes towards implementing three tiers of the system for detection and protection from harmful URLs. The first tier focuses on evaluating the performance of discriminative features in model creation. Discriminative features are derived fromURL details and "Whois" webpage information that helps in improving detection performance with less latency and low computational complexity. The influence of feature variation on Parametric (neural network) and non-parametric classifier detection results are assessed to narrow down to the most prominent features to be adapted in the best model for the task of identifying URLs with multi-categorization. The study reveals that non-parametric ensemble models like Light GBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest performed well with a detection accuracy of over 95%, which facilitated building a real-time detection system and differentiating multiple attack types (such as Malware, Phishing, and spam). The second tier focuses on validationwith a global database to know, if entered URL is reported as suspicious by various detection engines already.

A backdoor attack is a type of attack where hidden triggers are added to the input data during training, with the goal of changing the behavior of the model during inference. These attacks pose a significant security threat in critical applications, such as street sign or pedestrian recognition for autonomous vehicles, biometric authentication, image retrieval, semantic labeling, etc. To combat these threats, many defense mechanisms have been proposed. These methods target different areas, such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and thus utilize different assumptions about the nature of the input data and the type of backdoor trigger used in the attack. However, the attacker can exploit these assumptions, which reduces their successfulness in real-world scenarios. Thus, a robust method for backdoor detection needs to have broad and simple assumptions. Furthermore, detection methods that rely on the input data suffer from the fact that they are constrained to the modality of the input and cannot apply to different modalities. In this work, a novel method for backdoor detection and removal for classification tasks using features extracted by the attacked model called FEAT-IN is proposed. This method can detect and reconstruct the feature representation of the possible triggers used in attacking the neural network. Using these reconstructed trigger features, the method can be used to efficiently mitigate the effects of an attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and attack methods demonstrate that, when compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Neural Cleanse, Neural Attention Distillation, I-BAU, BTI-DBF etc. the FEAT-IN method provides several benefits. It can more consistently detect and mitigate backdoor attacks than similar trigger inversion defense methods that conduct the defense in the input space instead of feature space (where, on average, it achieves approx. 10% higher decrease in attack success rate during mitigation compared to the second-best method). Secondly, it reduces the memory footprint and the computation time by at least an order of magnitude compared to other methods, which allows FEAT-IN to be used practically in real-world scenarios. Finally, it is not constrained to only computer vision tasks, as this assumption holds for feature spaces of different problems, which is demonstrated by applying it without any change to semantic analysis on the SST-2 dataset.

The test is conducted by professionals hired by the organization that produces a report to the organization for further actions. However, the report produce varies according to the different tester. This is because there is no standardized format of a pen test report approved by any security organization or bodies. Each tester would submit a report based on the findings on their company's policy. We analyse eight pen test report available online to find any similarities or pattern so that we can come out with a standardized format which comprises of components we think is needed in the report. The proposed format will also cater to the understanding of both security system personnel and the upper management of the organization. This is due to the fact that technicality of the report may not be clear to the top management, which results in them taking less consideration upon the issues of vulnerabilities in their system. This standardized report will cater to the needs of both system security personnel and the upper management by taking further actions upon improving the security of their network, servers, computers, firewalls and all of the access channels of their system.

So far most of the literature considered exclusively real-valued graph signals. However, graph signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. This is the case for the AC carrier, and motivates its complex phasor representation. Focusing on applications in power systems, in this paper we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, incorporating a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) based on the admittance matrix of power grids in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued voltage phasor graph signals (GS). The theory developed is generalized to handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs can be stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, by bounding of the error propagation through multiple NN layers. The paper showcases the benefits of complex GCN relative to several benchmarks, in power grid state forecasting and cyber-attack detection and localization.

In case of usual cyber attack, commercial grade defence systems are available. Because of speciality of military system, cyber attacks for them are also special and the number is extremely small. For machine learning based defence system, the shortage of malware samples is critical problem. To solve this problem, we proposed the new method for amplifying opcode sequence which is part of the malware and used for malware detection. We first extract opcode sequences from malwares and benign portable files. To make them meaningful and easy to learn, whole opcode sequence is split into several blocks, called OPSEN(OPcode SENtence), using special delimiters. Considering that opcode sequence is not a numerical data but a sequence of instruction, we used SeqGAN with stochastic policy in reinforcement learning and policy gradient. The experimental results shows that the proposed amplified opcode sequence help to improve the detection rate.

However, cloud computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks. Therefore, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is very necessary for cloud computing system. There is a serious problem which traditional host-based IDS for cloud computing consumes a large amount of system resources. In this paper, we propose a centralized host-based IDS framework to reduce the use of the resources. Using logstash tool to collect the system logs from each virtual machine, and storing them into elasticsearch cluster centrally. After that, we analyze all these logs in the detection center and send the results to each virtual machine. We have validated our framework in the openstack platform. The results show a good performance in reducing the CPU and memory usage.

However, these strategies only focus on the cascading initiation phase to induce single-stage failures with multiple branch tripping, lacking of exploring the attack effectiveness in the propagation phase so that the deeply-hidden cascading failures are underestimated. In this paper, we propose a novel false load injection attack strategy that can intentionally penetrate into the cascading propagation phase to drive multi-stage dynamical failures with a cascading process. Specifically, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to model the adversarial game between operator and attacker. The former is in charge of security-constrained economic dispatching to minimize the generation cost, and the latter aims to maximize the cumulative number of tripped branches. Further, we reformulate this NP-hard bi-level problem as a mixed integer linear program for tractable computation. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on different-scale IEEE test systems to validate our strategy in driving the dynamical failures.

At present, generating adversarial patches based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) has been an emerging study. However, existing attack strategies are still far from producing local adversarial patches with strong attack power, ignoring the attacked network's perceived sensitivity to the adversarial patches. This paper studies the security threat of adversarial patches to classifiers; adding an adversarial patch to the data can mislead the classifier into incorrect results. Considering the attention to aggression and reality, we propose the data-driven MultiD-WGAN, which can simultaneously enhance adversarial patches' attack power and authenticity through multi-discriminators. The experiments confirm that our data-driven MultiD-WGAN dramatically reduces the recall of seven classifiers attacked on four datasets. The attack of data-driven MultiD-WGAN on 25/28 groups of experiments leads to a decreased recall rate, which is better than the conventional GANs. Finally, we have proved a positive correlation between attack intensity and attack ability, both theoretically and experimentally.

However, it is exposed to a security threat in which Byzantine participants can interrupt or control the learning process. Previous attack models assume that the rogue participants (a) are omniscient (know the data of all other participants), and (b) introduce large changes to the parameters. Accordingly, most defense mechanisms make a similar assumption and attempt to use statistically robust methods to identify and discard values whose reported gradients are far from the population mean. We observe that if the empirical variance between the gradients of workers is high enough, an attacker could take advantage of this and launch a non-omniscient attack that operates within the population variance. We show that the variance is indeed high enough even for simple datasets such as MNIST, allowing an attack that is not only undetected by existing defenses, but also uses their power against them, causing those defense mechanisms to consistently select the byzantine workers while discarding legitimate ones. We demonstrate our attack method works not only for preventing convergence but also for repurposing of the model behavior ("backdooring"). We show that less than 25% of colluding workers are sufficient to degrade the accuracy of models trained on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 by 50%, as well as to introduce backdoors without hurting the accuracy for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, but with a degradation for CIFAR100.

Securing social media for seniors from information attacks: Modeling, detecting, intervening, and communicating risks	2021 THIRD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRUST, PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (TPS-ISA 2021)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd EEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems and Applications (TPS-ISA)	DEC 13-15, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			social media; seniors; cybersecurity; vision	OPINION DYNAMICS; TECHNOLOGY; TOURISM	In this increasingly global and digitally connected society, we learn and interact with the world and gather information to make decisions by acquiring, processing, and curating digital data shared through cyberspace. While enabling timely distribution of digital data and facilitating rich social interfaces, cyberspace also comes with many vulnerabilities, e.g., manipulated digital data and misinformation that may adversely impact the user and their decision-making process. Although the need for connectivity and social belonging is universal, the segments of society which would benefit the most include children, who are learning about the world, and older adults - typically 65 years or above and referred to as seniors, who cherish old personal relationships. But they are also an extremely vulnerable group to potential cyber- attacks and phishing. In this paper, we layout some of the current challenges to ensuring safe cyberspace for senior adults, who can be misguided to cause irreparable personal, financial or physical harm to themselves or others through misinformation, and the research opportunities to turn the corner.

J	Hijji, M; Alam, G				Hijji, Mohammad; Alam, Gulzar			A Multivocal Literature Review on Growing Social Engineering Based Cyber-Attacks/Threats During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Prospective Solutions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Review						COVID-19; Pandemics; Organizations; Standards organizations; Computer hacking; Buildings; Social networking (online); Multivocal literature review; social engineering; COVID-19; security and privacy; prospective solutions; cyber-attacks and threats		The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a considerable and long-lasting social and economic impact on the world. Along with other potential challenges across different domains, it has brought numerous cybersecurity challenges that must be tackled timely to protect victims and critical infrastructure. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target. The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria. As an outcome of this research study; we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks. Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are; ransomware, trojans, and bots. We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The algorithms are mathematically secure, but the side-channel leakage poses a serious security threat. Innovative machine-learning classification methods have remarkably reduced the sampling time as well as the time required to recover the key. However, these results are constrained by high dimensionality, i.e. complex feature data increases the classification time, and at times results in false classification. In this paper, we aim to narrow down the feature space and determine which features contribute most, towards better classification accuracy, for key retrieval from a n AES implementation running over Kintex-7. We have provided a comparison of classifying the key bit as 0 or 1 with a varying number of samples and different sets of features. This paper gives practical results of different properties becoming features for extracted power signals using both feature selection and extraction methods.

On the one hand, models in high-fidelity simulators are typically "intractable" if one opts to describe them in a mathematical formulation in order to apply existing model-based approaches from the anomaly detection literature. On the other hand, pure data-driven methods developed primarily in the machine learning literature neglect our knowledge about the underlying dynamics of power systems. In this study, we combine tools from these two mainstream approaches to develop a data-assisted model-based diagnosis filter utilizing both the knowledge from a picked abstract model and also the data of simulation results from high-fidelity simulators. The proposed diagnosis filter aims to achieve two desired features: (i) performance robustness with respect to model mismatch; (ii) high scalability. To this end, we propose a tractable (convex) optimization-based reformulation in which decisions are the filter parameters, the model-based information introduces feasible sets, and the data from the simulator forms the objective function to-be-minimized regarding the effect of model mismatch on the filter performance. To validate the theoretical results, we implement the developed diagnosis filter in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to detect false data injection attacks on the Automatic Generation Control measurements in the three-area IEEE 39-bus system.

The IoT applications facilitate providing prompt emergency responses, and improved quality of vehicles, and road services, with cost-effective activities in the intelligent transportation systems. Federated Learning (FL) enhances privacy and security in intelligent transportation systems and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), using advanced prediction methods. Integrating blockchain with IoT, particularly in FL for transportation systems and IoV, bolsters security and data integrity. This approach keeps data local while only sharing model updates, enhancing privacy. Blockchain's transparency aids in efficient IoT collaboration, crucial for accountability. Its consensus algorithms further ensure network integrity, validating transactions and updates across devices, protecting against attacks, and fostering a transparent, collaborative environment. This comprehensive review paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning and the dynamic domain of IoV. It extensively analyzes the primary concepts, methodologies, and challenges associated with the deployment of FL in IoVs. This review presents a novel categorization examining three main types of blockchain-based FL approaches vertical, horizontal, and decentralized each tailored to specific IoV communication scenarios like Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C). It highlights FL applications in cyber-attack detection, data sharing, traffic prediction, and privacy, considering Quality of Service factors. Finally, some main challenges and new open issues are discussed and assessed for federated machine learning approaches in the IoV.

After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim model will produce adversary-specified outputs on the inputs embedded with predesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As a sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing (NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing textual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples as triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the backdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort. In this paper, we propose to use the syntactic structure as the trigger in textual backdoor attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the syntactic trigger-based attack method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100% success rate) to the insertion-based methods but possesses much higher invisibility and stronger resistance to defenses. These results also reveal the significant insidiousness and harmfulness of textual backdoor attacks. All the code and data of this paper can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/HiddenKiller.

One prominent security threat is backdoor attacks where the adversary party poisons a small subset of training datasets to implant a backdoor into the model, leading to misclassifications during runtime for triggered samples. To mitigate the attack, many defense methods have been proposed, such as detecting and removing poisoned samples or rectifying trojaned model weights in victim DNNs. However, existing approaches suffer from notable inefficiency as they are faced with large-scale training datasets, consequently rendering these defenses impractical in the real world. In this paper, we propose a lightweight backdoor identification and removal scheme, called REBACK. In this scheme, REBACK first extracts a subset of suspicious and benign samples, and then, proceeds with a "averaging and differencing" based method to identify target label(s). Next, leveraging the identification results, REBACK invokes a novel reverse engineering method to recover the exact trigger using only basic arithmetic atoms. Our experiments demonstrate that, for ImageNet with 750 labels, REBACK can defend against backdoor attacks in around 2 hours, showcasing a speed improvement of 18.5x to 214x compared to existing methods. For backdoor removal, the attack success rate can be decreased to 0.05% owing to 99% cosine similarity of the reversed triggers. The code is online available.

Traditional approaches in machine learning techniques are insufficient to access the control in IoT management on single-point failure. To solve this issue, a novel Decentralized and Secure Framework is proposed and an accredited access control scheme is introduced by integrating blockchain with local peers to record each transaction by checking the signature to access. Then, attribute-based cryptography through blockchain is provided to ensure data privacy on storage by defining threshold parameters, preserving keys, and removing users on the blockchain. Finally, a Smart contract-based DoS attack mitigation technique has been incorporated to prevent the server from overwhelming through effective validation of devices with smart contracts as trusted or untrusted. Thus, the proposed framework provides access control, maintains data privacy, and mitigates the cyber-attack.

Unlike horizontal FL (HFL), which expands the sample space by aggregating local models, vertical FL (VFL) is suitable for scenarios where the sample ID between participants is the same but differs in sample characteristics. For a long time, VFL has been considered safe due to no data exchange and heterogeneity between parties. However, the recently proposed label inference attacks pose a significant security threat to VFL. Specifically, by adding randomly initialized layers to the top of local models, the passive label inference attack can infer tens of thousands of local participants' private data with only 40 auxiliary labels. Since the attack is entirely local, using privacy protection technologies such as differential privacy cannot effectively defend against these attacks. Therefore, we propose a new privacy protection scheme called FL similar gradients (FLSGs) to defend against this attack. Unlike differential privacy, the FLSG scheme randomly generates gradients of a Gaussian distribution similar in dimension to the original gradients and calculates their cosine distance. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the gradients are used instead of the original gradients to pass to the local participants. We conducted extensive evaluations on six real-world data sets, and the results show that FLSG provides a better defensive effect at lower computational overhead than other known methods when defending the passive label inference attack.

Due to practical constraints in preventing phishing through a public network or insecure communication channels, simple PUF-based authentication protocol with unrestricted queries and transparent responses is vulnerable to modeling and replay attacks. In this article, we present a modeling attack resistant PUF-based mutual authentication scheme to mitigate the practical limitations in applications where a resource-rich server authenticates a device with no strong restriction imposed on the type of PUF design or any additional protection on the binary channel used for the authentication. Our scheme uses an active deception protocol to prevent machine learning (ML) attacks on a device with a monolithic integration of a genuine strong PUF (SPUF), a fake PUF, a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), a register, a binary counter, a comparator, and a simple controller. The hardware encapsulation makes the collection of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) easy for model building during enrollment but prohibitively time consuming upon device deployment through the same interface. A genuine server can perform a mutual authentication with the device using a combined fresh challenge contributed by both the server and the device. The message exchanged in clear cannot be manipulated by the adversary to derive unused authentic CRPs. The adversary will have to either wait for an impractically long time to collect enough real CRPs by directly querying the device or the ML model derived from the collected CRPs will be poisoned. The false PUF multiplexing is fortified against the prediction of waiting time by doubling the time penalty for every unsuccessful guess. Our implementation results on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device and security analysis have corroborated the low hardware overheads and attack resistance of the proposed deception protocol.

However, the integration of intelligence and cyber system to a smart grid can result in serious cyber security concerns and presents the entire power system more vulnerable to be attacked. In this paper, a new cyber attack model with the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) based optimal power flow (OPF) problem is introduced and exploited by malicious attackers. To deal with this challenge, a defence mechanism is presented to not only detect the existence of data injection attack, but also mitigate the potential impact to improve the stability of the smart grid. This scheme takes the power measurements between neighbouring nodes into account, and distinguishes the time-delay attack and bad data injection attack by monitoring the measurement variations between received data and predicted data based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has the capability of detecting and mitigating the stealthy attacks significantly by using a 33-bus power system. Consequently, it is a significant study in the actual smart grid and can minimise the impact of the cyber attack.

J	Mohammed, MA; Ibrahim, DA; Salman, AO				Mohammed, Mazin Abed; Ibrahim, Dheyaa Ahmed; Salman, Akbal Omran			Adaptive intelligent learning approach based on visual anti-spam email model for multi-natural language	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						anti-spam detection; machine learning techniques; adaptive intelligent learning; multi-natural language; multi-agent system; Naive Bayes classifier	SYSTEM	Spam electronic mails (emails) refer to harmful and unwanted commercial emails sent to corporate bodies or individuals to cause harm. Even though such mails are often used for advertising services and products, they sometimes contain links to malware or phishing hosting websites through which private information can be stolen. This study shows how the adaptive intelligent learning approach, based on the visual anti-spam model for multi-natural language, can be used to detect abnormal situations effectively. The application of this approach is for spam filtering. With adaptive intelligent learning, high performance is achieved alongside a low false detection rate. There are three main phases through which the approach functions intelligently to ascertain if an email is legitimate based on the knowledge that has been gathered previously during the course of training. The proposed approach includes two models to identify the phishing emails. The first model has proposed to identify the type of the language. New trainable model based on Naive Bayes classifier has also been proposed. The proposed model is trained on three types of languages (Arabic, English and Chinese) and the trained model has used to identify the language type and use the label for the next model. The second model has been built by using two classes (phishing and normal email for each language) as a training data. The second trained model (Naive Bayes classifier) has been applied to identify the phishing emails as a final decision for the proposed approach. The proposed strategy is implemented using the Java environments and JADE agent platform. The testing of the performance of the AIA learning model involved the use of a dataset that is made up of 2,000 emails, and the results proved the efficiency of the model in accurately detecting and filtering a wide range of spam emails. The results of our study suggest that the Naive Bayes classifier performed ideally when tested on a database that has the biggest estimate (having a general accuracy of 98.4%, false positive rate of 0.08%, and false negative rate of 2.90%). This indicates that our Naive Bayes classifier algorithm will work viably on the off chance, connected to a real-world database, which is more common but not the largest.

One effective countermeasure against such threats involves detecting vulnerable IoT devices by identifying the models of connected IoT devices. Several studies have concentrated on model identification methods that utilize flow and communication data to identify IoT device models. With the advances in machine learning and deep learning, high identification accuracy has been reported under certain conditions. However, when implementing these research findings, selecting the most suitable model for the application is crucial. This selection process presents challenges in terms of reproducibility and applicability. The issue of reproducibility lies in the difficulty of implementing a model that accurately reproduces the methods outlined in the paper. The applicability issue arises when attempting to select the best method based solely on the experimental results described in the papers, as difference studies have conducted these experiments on different datasets across various papers. This study focused on IoT device model identification using flow data. We surveyed existing studies and selected a method with high reproducibility. Additionally, we conducted experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the selected methods using multiple datasets under uniform conditions for feature values and dataset usage. Consequently, we identified the optimal method in terms of both reproducibility and applicability within the scope of our study.

With the rapid growth in malware programs, categorical isolation of malware is no longer satisfactory for security risk management. It is more pragmatic to focus the limited resources on identifying the small fraction of malware programs of high security impact. In this paper, we define a new research issue of measuring and predicting the impact of the detected Android malware. To address this issue, we first propose two metrics to isolate the high impact Android malware programs from the low impact ones. With the proposed metrics, we created a new research dataset including high impact and low impact Android malware samples. The dataset allows us to empirically discover the driving factors for the high malware impact. To characterize the differences between high impact and low impact Android malware, we leverage features from two sources available in every Android application. (1) the readily available AndroidManifest.xml file and (2) the disassembled code from the compiled binary. From these characteristics, we trained a highly accurate classifier to identify high impact Android malware. The experimental results show that our proposed method is feasible and has great potential in predicting the impact of Android malware in general.

More importantly, some adversarial examples crafted against an ensemble of pre-trained source models can transfer to other new target models, thus pose a security threat to black-box applications (when the attackers have no access to the target models). Despite adopting diverse architectures and parameters, source and target models often share similar decision boundaries. Therefore, if an adversary is capable of fooling several source models concurrently, it can potentially capture intrinsic transferable adversarial information that may allow it to fool a broad class of other black-box target models. Current ensemble attacks, however, only consider a limited number of source models to craft an adversary, and obtain poor transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack, dubbed Serial-Mini-Batch-Ensemble-Attack (SMBEA). SMBEA divides a large number of pre-trained source models into several mini-batches. For each single batch, we design 3 new ensemble strategies to improve the intra-batch transferability. Besides, we propose a new algorithm that recursively accumulates the "long-term" gradient memories of the previous batch to the following batch. This way, the learned adversarial information can be preserved and the inter-batch transferability can be improved. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble attacks over multiple pixel-to-pixel vision tasks including image translation and salient region prediction. Our method successfully fools two online black-box saliency prediction systems including DeepGaze-II (Kummerer 2017) and SALICON (Huang et al. 2017). Finally, we also contribute a new repository to promote the research on adversarial attack and defense over pixel-to-pixel tasks: https://github.com/CZHQuality/AAA-Pix2pix.

J	Luo, XQ				Luo, Xianquan			Secure Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Strategy Based on Reputation Mechanism for Cognitive Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Sensors; Cascading style sheets; Reliability; Wireless sensor networks; Cognitive radio; Interference; Security; Cooperative spectrum sensing; reputation mechanism; cognitive wireless sensor networks; cognitive radio	MALICIOUS USER DETECTION; RADIO NETWORKS; ATTACK; SCHEME	Cooperative spectrum sensing can be regarded as a promising method to resolve the spectrum scarcity owing to achieving spatial diversity gain in cognitive radio sensor networks. However, the spectrum sensing data falsification attack launched by the malicious nodes will result in the wrong decision in the fusion center owing to the falsified observations. It will cause a serious security threat and degrade the decision making process. In this paper, we propose a secure cooperative spectrum sensing strategy based on reputation mechanism for cognitive wireless sensor networks to counter above kind of attack. The beta reputation model is applied to assign reputation value to cognitive sensor nodes according to their historical sensing behavior, and a dynamic trust evaluation scheme of cooperative spectrum sensing is established. In the final decision, the fusion center allocates a reasonable weight value according to the evaluation of the submitted observations to improve the accuracy of the sensing results. Simulation results support that our proposed strategy can weaken the impact of sensing data falsification attacks in cooperative sensing and outperform some traditional methods.

While we benefit from such techniques in many ways, they can be a serious security threat to the Internet if malicious attackers become able to utilize them to detect software vulnerabilities. This paper introduces a new concept of self-evolving botnets, where computing resources of infected hosts are exploited to discover unknown vulnerabilities in non-infected hosts. We propose a stochastic epidemic model that incorporates such a feature of botnets, and show its behaviors through numerical experiments and simulations.

To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step. Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks. Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively. To assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.

Scammers take advantage of that by using well-known organizations' logos on malicious websites. Unsuspecting Internet users see these logos and think they are looking at a government website or legitimate webshop, when it is a phishing site, a counterfeit webshop, or a site set up to spread misinformation. We present the largest logo detection study on websites to date. We analyze 6.2M domain names from the Netherlands' country-code top-level domain .nl, in two case studies to detect logo misuse for two organizations: the Dutch national government and Thuiswinkel Waarborg, an organization that issues certified webshop trust marks. We show how we can detect phishing, spear phishing, dormant phishing attacks, and brand misuse. To that end, we developed LogoMotive, an application that crawls domain names, generates screenshots, and detects logos using supervised machine learning. LogoMotive is operational in the .nl registry, and it is generalizable to detect any other logo in any DNS zone to help identify abuse.	[van den Hout, Thijs; Wabeke, Thymen; Moura, Giovane C.

The classical approach for user authentication is the username and password pair, which is known to be vulnerable to leaks created by various attack techniques (phishing, keystroke logger, web server database breaking, etc.). The main solution for this has been One Time Passwords, but they have the general disadvantage of needing additional specialized devices, that the user has to use and manage. New solutions have been lately proposed that use QR codes to distribute the authentication process between the computer, the smart phone of the user and the server to which she/he needs to authenticate. This paper makes a step further in distributing the authentication, by proposing the use of cloud cryptography in the process, thus relieving the smart phone from the burden of private key management and of performing high cost cryptographic operations. The paper describes the proposition through a proof-of-concept which is analyzed from the point of view of the advantages thus obtained.

Toward Predictin Secure Environments for Wearable Devices	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	50th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences(HICSS)	JAN 03-07, 2017	HI					Wearable devices have become more common for the average consumer. As devices need to operate with low power, many devices use simplified security measures to secure the data during transmission. While Bluetooth, the primary method of communication, includes certain security measures as part of the format, they are insufficient to fully secure the connection and the data transmitted. Users must be made aware of the potential security threats to the information communicated by the wearable, as well as be empowered and engaged to protect it. In this paper, we propose a method of identifying insecure environments through crowdsourced data, allowing wearable consumers to deploy an application on their base system (e.g., a smart phone) that alerts when in the presence of a security threat. We examine two different machine learning methods for classifying the environment and interacting with the users, as well as evaluating the potential uses for both algorithms.

One of the main features of an adaptive UAV protection system is the analysis of its cyber-physical parameters. An attack on a general-purpose computer system mainly affects the integrity, confidentiality and availability of important information. By contrast, an attack on a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), such as a UAV, affects the functionality of the system and may disrupt its operation, ultimately preventing it from fulfilling its tasks correctly. Cyber-physical parameters are the internal parameters of a system node, including the states of its computing resources, data storage, actuators and sensor system. Here, we develop a data normalization technique that additionally allows us to identify the signs of a cyber-attack. In addition, we define sets of parameters that can highlight an attack and define a new database format to support intrusion detection for UAVs. To achieve these goals, we performed an experimental study of the impact of attacks on UAV parameters and developed a software module for collecting data from UAVs, as well as a technique for normalizing and presenting data for detecting attacks on UAVs. Data analysis and the evaluation of the quality of a parameter (whether the parameter changes normally, or abrupt anomalous changes are observed) are facilitated by converting different types of data to the same format. The resulting formalized CPS model allows us to identify the nature of an attack and its potential impact on UAV subsystems. In the future, such a model could be the basis of a CPS digital twin in terms of security. The presented normalization technique supports processing raw data, as well as classifying data sets for their use in machine learning (ML) analyses in the future. The data normalization technique can also help to immediately determine the presence and signs of an attack, which allows classifying raw data automatically by dividing it into different categories. Such a technique could form the basis of an intrusion detection system for CPSs. Thus, the obtained results can be used to classify attacks, including attack detection systems based on machine learning methods, and the data normalization technique can be used as an independent method for detecting attacks.

Such attacks can make models perform abnormally on inputs with predefined triggers and still retain state-of-the-art performance on clean data. While backdoor attacks have been thoroughly investigated in the image domain from both attackers' and defenders' sides, an analysis in the frequency domain has been missing thus far. This paper first revisits existing backdoor triggers from a frequency perspective and performs a comprehensive analysis. Our results show that many current backdoor attacks exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, which persist across different datasets and resolutions. We further demonstrate these high-frequency artifacts enable a simple way to detect existing backdoor triggers at a detection rate of 98.50% without prior knowledge of the attack details and the target model. Acknowledging previous attacks' weaknesses, we propose a practical way to create smooth backdoor triggers without high-frequency artifacts and study their detectability. We show that existing defense works can benefit by incorporating these smooth triggers into their design consideration. Moreover, we show that the detector tuned over stronger smooth triggers can generalize well to unseen weak smooth triggers. In short, our work emphasizes the importance of considering frequency analysis when designing both backdoor attacks and defenses in deep learning.

Therefore, security management tools must assess the cyber-risk of an enterprise at regular intervals by comprehensively identifying associations among attack techniques, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. However, existing repositories providing such associations are incomplete (i.e., missing associations), which increases the likelihood of undermining the risk of specific set of attack techniques with missing information. Further, such associations often rely on manual interpretations that are slow compared to the speed of attacks, and therefore, ineffective in combating the ever increasing list of vulnerabilities and attack actions. Therefore, developing methodologies to associate vulnerabilities to all relevant attack techniques automatically and accurately is critically important. In this paper, we present a framework - Vulnerabilities and Weakness to Common Attack Pattern Mapping (VWC-MAP) - that can automatically identify all relevant attack techniques of a vulnerability via weakness based on their text descriptions, applying natural language process (NLP) techniques. VWC-MAP is enabled by a novel two-tiered classification approach, where the first tier classifies vulnerabilities to weakness, and the second tier classifies weakness to attack techniques. In this work, we improve the scalability of the current state-of-the-art tool to significantly speedup the mapping of vulnerabilities to weaknesses. We also present two novel automated approaches for mapping weakness to attack techniques by applying Text-to-Text and link prediction techniques. Our experimental results are cross-validated by cyber-security experts and demonstrate that VWC-MAP can associate vulnerabilities to weakness-types with up to 87% accuracy, and weaknesses to new attack patterns with up to 80% accuracy.

However, existing backdoor removal methods often work independently and struggle to generalize across various attacks, which limits their effectiveness when the specific methods used by attackers are unknown. To effectively defend against multiple backdoor attacks, in this paper, we propose the Reinforcement Learning-based Backdoor Removal (RLBR) framework, which integrates multiple defense strategies and dynamically switches various defense methods during the removal process. Driven by the knowledge we observed that a) neuron activation patterns vary significantly under different attacks, and b) these patterns dynamically change during the removal process, we take the neuron activation pattern of the poisoned models as the environment state in the RLBR framework. Besides, we evaluate the defense effectiveness as rewards to guide the selection of optimal defense strategy at each decision point. Through extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art backdoor attacks on two benchmark datasets, RLBR improved defensive performance by 6.91% while maintaining an accuracy of 92.63% on clean datasets, compared to seven baseline backdoor defense methods.

Information about such cyber-attacks is often in unstructured text data and metadata, a rich source of evidence in a digital forensic investigation. However, such information is usually unavailable during a digital forensic investigation when dealing with the public cloud post-incident. Furthermore, digital investigators are challenged with extracting meaningful semantic content from the raw syntactic and unstructured data. It is partly due to the lack of a structured process for forensic data pre-processing when or if such information is identified. Thus, this study seeks to address the lack of a procedure or technique to extract semantic meaning from text data of a cybercrime attack that could be used as a digital forensic readiness semantics trigger in a cybercrime detection process. For the methodology to address the proposed approach, data science modelling and unsupervised machine learning are used to design a strategy. This method process extracts tokens of cybercrime text data, which are further used to develop an intelligent DFR semantic tool extractor based on natural language patterns from cybercrime text data. The proposed DFR cybercrime semantic trigger process when implemented could be used to create a digital forensic cybercrime language API for all digital forensic investigation systems or tools.

While a few morphing attack detection (MAD) methods have been proposed, the face morphing accomplice's facial restoration has not received sufficient attention. Due to the inability to foresee the morphing factor used for a particular morphed image, selecting the appropriate de-morphing factor becomes a challenging problem in the restoration of the accomplice's facial image. If the morphing factor cannot be chosen reasonably, achieving the desired restoration effect is difficult. Therefore, this paper presents an adaptive de-morphing factor framework (ADFF) architecture for restoring the accomplice's facial image. By exploiting the morphed images stored in the electronic passport system and the real-time captured criminal's images, ADFF can effectively restore the accomplice's facial image. Experimental results and analysis show that ADFF can significantly reduce the security threats of MAs on ABC. Here, an adaptive de-morphing factor framework (ADFF) is proposed to restore the accomplice's facial image.

Previous works studied this threat from the aspects of dataset and model. However, with the increasing developments of CNN accelerators nowadays, the role of hardware in this threat lacks attentions. This paper inserts a hardware Trojan into the convolutional operations of a FPGA CNN accelerator. The experiments on ImageNet show that, with only 0.0051% hardware overhead to the accelerator and 0.000356% modification to an image, the hardware Trojan can be triggered to 100% precisely control the CNN classification result of the image.

The synchronization strategy is based on static output feedback controller followed by an event-triggered scheme. The communication network is assumed to be under various types of cyber-attacks, namely, deception, replay, and denial-of-service attacks. All these attacks are investigated in a unified Markovian jump framework. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory and stochastic analysis techniques, some design criteria are derived and formulated in terms of matrix inequalities. A convex optimization algorithm is proposed to design the static output feedback controller. Finally, two chaotic examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the eventtriggered static output feedback controller. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Verma, P; Dasgupta, P; Chakraborty, C				Verma, Praveen; Dasgupta, Pallab; Chakraborty, Chandan			Defense against stealthy dummy Load Redistribution attacks	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Cyber attack; Cyber security; Dummy Load Redistribution attack; Load Redistribution attack; Power grid security; Smart electrical grids; Transmission congestion	SYSTEM	Load Redistribution (LR) attacks operate by adversarial manipulations of load measurements in electrical power grids. Machine Learning (ML) based detectors have been effective to detect LR attacks where the attacked load vectors are outliers of the distribution of normal load vectors. On the other hand a recent family of attacks, known as dummy LR attacks, are capable of bypassing the ML-based detectors by choosing attack load vectors that are not outliers. This paper presents an approach for defense against such stealthy third-generation dummy LR attacks by identifying and monitoring critical loads. A case study on the IEEE 30 bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for defense against dummy LR attacks.

In this paper, a pressurized water nuclear power plant control system is analyzed, formally described, and modeled using Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL), identifying the plant architecture, connections, vulnerabilities, assets, possible attack instances as well as their pre-and pos-conditions. The generated plant model is then verified against a security property using JKind model checker integrated tool. The union of the generated attack sequences resulting in overall plant disruption (i.e., Attack Graph) is graphically presented using C# language in Microsoft Visual Studio.

However, recent events show that the vulnerabilities exposed in the cyber side and the physical side can be exploited to cause coupled and severe effects. Especially, the adversaries are able to mask the pernicious physical attack using the cyber attack by compromising the digitized data transmitted to the control center. This cooperative cyber-physical attack (CCPA) is stealthy to the current defense mechanism. In this article, we propose a cyber-physical defensive mechanism (CPDM) to thwart the CCPA. By changing the physical value of the line admittance, the model parameters known by the adversary are not useful anymore, which is the basic idea to design the CPDM. The implementation of CPDM depends on the deployment of the distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To reduce the infrastructure cost for the CPDM, we investigate the minimum number of required D-FACTS devices to thwart the CCPA. We consider both weak constraints on the CCPA and CPDM and practical limitations for the CCPA and CPDM. For each case, we propose a method to compute the optimal deployment of D-FACTS devices, that is, where the D-FACTS device should be deployed.

Recently, a hybrid data-driven physics-based model framework for monitoring the smart grid is developed. However, the framework has not been implemented in real-time environment yet. In this paper, the framework of the hybrid model is developed within a real-time simulation environment. OPAL-RT real-time simulator is used to enable Hardware-in-the-Loop testing of the framework. IEEE 9-bus system is considered as a testing grid for gaining insight. The process of building the framework and the challenges faced during development are presented. The performance of the framework is investigated under various false data injection attacks.

Although numerous studies were conducted for the URL classification task, the traditional URL classification solutions retreated due to the hand-crafted feature engineering and the boom of newly generated URLs. In this paper, we study the representation learning of URLs, and explore the URI: classification using deep learning Specifically, we propose URL2vec to extract both the structural and lexical features of URLs, and apply temporal convolutional network (TCN) for the URL classification task. The experimental results show that URL2vec outperforms both word2vec and character-level embedding for URL representation, and TCN achieves the best performance than baselines with the precision up to 95.97%.

In this paper, we develop a deep learning based methodology for detection, localization, and data recovery of FDIA on power systems in a coherent and holistic manner. However, the multi-modal probability distributions of both measurements and state variables in SE due to ever-changing operating points and structural/topological changes pose great challenges in detecting and localizing FDIA. To address this challenge, we first propose an enhanced attack model to launch massive FDIA on limited access points. Second, we train an auto-encoder (AE) with a Bayesian change verification (BCV) classifier using N-1 contingencies to detect FDIA with unseen N-k operational topologies. Third, to avoid model collapse caused by multi-modal measurement distribution, an AE-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is derived to generate a diverse candidate set of normal measurement vectors with various operational topologies. Finally, we develop a pattern match algorithm to localize and recover the falsified measurements and state variables by comparing the falsified measurement vectors with the normal measurement vectors in the candidate set. Case studies with IEEE benchmark systems and a modified 415-bus China Southern Grid system are provided to validate the proposed methodology. It shows that the proposed methodology achieves an average 95% accuracy for detection, over 80% accuracy for localization of FDIA, and recovers the measurement and state variables close to their true values.

Traditional backdoor attacks intend to inject backdoor functionality into the model such that the backdoored model will perform abnormally on inputs with predefined backdoor triggers and still retain state-of-the-art performance on the clean inputs. While there are already some works on backdoor attacks on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the backdoor trigger in the graph domain is mostly injected into random positions of the sample. There is no work analyzing and explaining the backdoor attack performance when injecting triggers into the most important or least important area in the sample, which we refer to as trigger-injecting strategies MIAS and LIAS, respectively. Our results show that, generally, LIAS performs better, and the differences between the LIAS and MIAS performance can be significant. Furthermore, we explain these two strategies' similar (better) attack performance through explanation techniques, which results in a further understanding of backdoor attacks in GNNs.

In this work, we design an AMD hunter in the context of VirusTotal to hunt for AMDs and reveal new threats for Android. First, the AMD hunter sifts through millions of file submissions on VirusTotal efficiently and alert more suspicious submission traces. Second, it performs package level analysis, static code and dynamic analyses on the APKs of the suspicious submissions to validate the AMDs. The implemented hunter has been used in a leading security company for 4 months, which processed 153 million of submissions on VirusTotal, and identified 1,623 AMDs with 13,855 samples from 83 countries. We also performed case studies on 890 malware samples selected from the identified AMDs, which revealed lots of new threats, including the development cases of fake system/banking phishing app, new rooting exploits, new JavaScript based threats, new evasions and AV probing malware. We wrote industry research articles about some AMDs and notified other security vendors to help patch their false negatives. Besides raising the awareness of the existence of AMDs, more importantly, our research provides the first systematic and efficient way to study the malware development phenomenon on VirusTotal. We will share all the samples of the identified AMDs with the research community.

With such a large scale growth of data, a need to privacy and security of the data is essentially considered. Such growth of data is also due to increase in services on offer by many private sector business providers. In recent years many technique were floated to deal with control the security threat to an organization. There are many trigonometric functions that generate multiple valued characteristics. This essentially generates two or more than two values for every object in data base. This preprocessing is used for a data set before subjecting it to latest technology of Artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and data mining supervised or unsupervised learning. In the current research simulations have been performed on without compromising intended business.	[Upadhyay, A. K.] AUMP Gwalior, CSE, ASET, Gwalior, India; [Jain, S.

A Secure IoT-Based Irrigation System for Precision Agriculture Using the Expeditious Cipher	SENSORS			English	Article						precision agriculture; lightweight encryption; MQTT; smart irrigation; IoT; expeditious cipher; AES; PRESENT; lightweight cryptography	MQTT	Due to the recent advances in the domain of smart agriculture as a result of integrating traditional agriculture and the latest information technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), there is an urgent need to address the information security-related issues and challenges in this field. In this article, we propose the integration of lightweight cryptography techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we investigate the adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely, the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker in the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel between the broker and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation systems, and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of natural resources by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation. This secure channel is utilized to eliminate the main security threat in precision agriculture by protecting sensors' published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops' development. In addition, the secure channel protects the irrigation decisions made by the data analytics (DA) entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned to actuators from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power consumption, execution time, and required memory usage when compared with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover, the selected lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the PRESENT lightweight encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage.

J	Koga, K; Takemoto, K				Koga, Kazuki; Takemoto, Kazuhiro			Simple Black-Box Universal Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification	ALGORITHMS			English	Article						black-box algorithm; deep neural networks; adversarial attacks; medical imaging	DISEASES	Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN) tasks using only a single perturbation called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), are a realistic security threat to the practical application of a DNN for medical imaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a black-box condition in which only input queries are allowed and outputs are accessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms for generating UAPs are limited to white-box conditions in which adversaries can access model parameters. Nevertheless, we propose a method for generating UAPs using a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs to demonstrate that UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under black-box conditions with representative DNN-based medical image classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both nontargeted and targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success rates (40-90%). The vulnerability of the black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures. The results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple procedure under the black-box condition to foil or control diagnostic medical imaging systems based on DNNs, and that UAPs are a more serious security threat.

The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has become more relevant in identifying and forecasting such cascading failures. In this article, we develop a real-time early stage mechanism (RESP) to predict cascading failures due to cyberattacks in smart grid systems using supervised ML algorithms. We use a realistic methodology to create a dataset to train the algorithms and predict the state of all components of the system after failure propagation. We utilize the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and consider the features of both the power and communication networks to improve the failure prediction accuracy. We use the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to simulate the power system and make the system more applicable. We evaluate the mechanism's effectiveness using the IEEE 14-bus system, which results in the XGBoost algorithm achieving a 96.25% prediction accuracy rate in random attacks. We show that RESP can accurately predict the state of a power system in the early stages of failure propagation using real-time data. Furthermore, we show that RESP can identify the initial failure locations, which can aid in further protection plans and decisions.

Although fuzzing shows excellent results for code coverage and crash count, it is not easy to apply these effects to library fuzzing. A library cannot run independently; it is only executed by an application called a customer program. In particular, a fuzzing executable and a seed corpus are needed to execute the library code by calling a specific function sequence and passing the input of the fuzzer to reproduce the various states of the library. However, preparing the environment for library fuzzing is challenging because it relies on the human expertise and requires both an understanding of the library and fuzzing knowledge. This study proposes FuzzBuilderEx, a system that provides an automated fuzzing environment for a library by utilizing the test framework to resolve this problem. FuzzBuilderEx conducts a static/dynamic analysis of the test code to automatically generate seed corpus and fuzzing executables that enable library fuzzing. Furthermore, the automatically generated seed corpus and fuzzing executable are compatible with existing fuzzers, such as the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). This study applied FuzzBuilderEx to nine open-source libraries for performance evaluation and confirmed the effects of an increase in code coverage by 31.2% and a unique crash count of 58.7% compared to previous studies.

Passivity Based Control of Cyber Physical Systems Under Zero-Dynamics Attack	HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS)	APR 18-20, 2016	Seville, SPAIN			Cyber Physical System; Security; Back-steeping; Sensor network		Introduction of computer networks in communication and control of the industrial setups has given rise to the new concept of Cyber Physical System. These control systems are vulnerable to the stealthy cyber-attacks as they are connected to communication networks. Cyber Attacks can cause malfunctioning of plants i.e. abnormal operational behavior, instability, etc. So it is of prime importance to control the unit under cyber-attack in order to protect the whole setup from damage. Passivity is a system property that enables the system designer to devise an energy based control of general dynamic systems. In this paper passive architecture of Cyber Physical Systems is discussed. To prevent the excitation of unstable zeros of system in stealthy attacks like zero-dynamics attack, back-stepping technique is employed to make zero-dynamics of closed loop the system stable. This technique is also used to develop a control law that will prevent the system from reaching unstable region if it is under zero-dynamics attack.

Many of the applications of micro-PMUs work based on the analysis of events in the stream of synchrophasor measurements to achieve situational awareness. A key step in almost every event-based method in this emerging field is to classify the type of the event, where classification can be done with respect to various factors. However, if the task of event classification is compromised, then an adversary can highly affect the perception of the utility operator and undermine any event-based application that makes use of the event classification results. In this paper, we explore a new cyber-threat against data-driven event classification in micro-PMU measurements. In particular, we model the poisoning attack against support vector machine (SVM) as the method of event classification; which has been used in practice to study distribution synchrophasors. We apply the new attack model to an event classifier that uses real-world micro-PMU data. In addition to conducting vulnerability analysis, we also propose a novel attack detection method which can detect and evaluate the changes in the decision boundary of the SVM due to the poisoning attack. The proposed attack detection method is also able to identify the number of poisoned data points in the training dataset.

In this work, we study the problem that an external attacker implements covert sensor and actuator attacks with resource constraints (the total resource consumption of the attacks is not greater than a given initial resource of the attacker) to mislead a discrete event system under supervisory control to reach unsafe states. We consider that the attacker can implement two types of attacks: One by modifying the sensor readings observed by a supervisor and the other by enabling the actuator commands disabled by the supervisor. Each attack has its corresponding resource consumption and remains covert. To solve this problem, we first introduce a notion of combined-attackability to determine whether a closed-loop system may reach an unsafe state after receiving attacks with resource constraints. We develop an algorithm to construct a corrupted supervisor under attacks, provide a verification method for combined-attackability in polynomial time based on a plant, a corrupted supervisor, and an attacker's initial resource, and propose a corresponding attack synthesis algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example.

Communication/Information infrastructure is the backbone of the smart grid system where different grid components are connected with each other through this structure. Therefore, the drawbacks of the information technology related issues are also becoming a part of the smart grid. Further, smart grid is also vulnerable to the grid related disturbances. For such a dynamic system, disturbance and intrusion detection is a paramount issue. This paper presents a Simulink and OPNET based co-simulated platform to carry out a cyber-intrusion in a cyber-network for modern power systems and smart grids. The cyber-attack effect is also characterized for the physical power system. The effectiveness of the co-simulated platform is demonstrated by the IEEE 30 bus power system model. The distributed denial of service attack, in terms of tampering with the circuit breaker reclosing signal was carried out in the cyber network to see its effect on the physical network. Different physical fault situations in the test system are considered and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed co-simulated scheme.	[Sadi, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain; Ali, Mohd.

Recently, backdoor attacks pose a new security threat to the training process of GNNs. Attackers intend to inject backdoors into GNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be changed to target label when the trigger is present. However, existing works on backdoor attacks could not attack arbitrary nodes effectively and achieve high performance on both nodes with discrete features and that with continuous features. In this paper, we propose a general backdoor attack to GNNs which could effectively attack arbitrary nodes while keeping other nodes unaffected as much as possible. We first ensure some important edges for a target node by utilizing edge explanation method and remove these edges if the edge exists before (vice versa). Then we ensure important features by using feature explanation method and use a neural network to optimize these features to obtain feature triggers (i.e., perturbation). Finally, we inject edge and feature triggers into target nodes to implement attack. We evaluate our attack from two aspects including generality and effectiveness. For the first part, our attack is effective on both datasets with discrete features and continuous features. For the second part, we randomly select different node subset with different size (e.g., 20, 50, 100 nodes) as target nodes and our attack achieves higher performance against other two state-of-the-art attacks.

Despite the importance of this kind of attack, the development and comparison of Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) methods is still a challenging task, especially with deep learning approaches. Specifically, the lack of public datasets, the absence of common training and validation protocols, and the limited release of public source code hamper the reproducibility and objective comparison of new MAD systems. Usually, these aspects are mainly due to privacy concerns, that limit data transfers and storage, and to the recent introduction of the MAD task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and publicly release Revelio, a modular framework for the reproducible development and evaluation of MAD systems. We include an overview of the modules, and describe the plugin system providing the possibility of extending native components with new functionalities. An extensive cross-datasets experimental evaluation is conducted to validate the framework and the performance of trained models on several publicly-released datasets, and to deeply analyze the main challenges in the MAD task based on single input images. We also propose a new metric, namely WAED, to summarize in a single value the error-based metrics commonly used in the MAD task, computed over different datasets, thus facilitating the comparative evaluation of different approaches. Finally, by exploiting Revelio, a new state-of-the-art MAD model (on SOTAMD single-image benchmark) is proposed and released.

In the past, the voice was generated through several stages of recording frequently used sentences and synthesizing text into sounds that wanted to be converted. However, due to the limitations of naturalness and accuracy, research has been conducted to overcome this in various fields such as phonetics, linguistics, and statistics, and now the development of big data, AI technology, and parallel processing technology has increased to reflect human tone and timbre. If the voice information, which is one of the biometric information that can be used as personally identifiable information, can be made so natural that it is difficult for a machine to distinguish it from a human, personal information may be invaded by a security threat that may exist at any time. Therefore, in this paper, we explain representative speech synthesis models and introduce voice generation models, which are applications, to find out how to convert and synthesize Korean into other languages, and to look at what may become a security issue in the future.

Cyber Physical Defense Framework for Distributed Smart Grid Applications	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						cyber-physical security; smart grid architecture model; NIST-National Institute of Standards and Technology; attack vector formulation; risk assesment; DDoS atacks; FDI attack		Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is the amalgamation of highly sophisticated sensors with physical spaces. These close conjunctions of sensors with communication infrastructure intrinsically linking to society's Critical Infrastructures (C.I.) are being witnessed more often in the context of Smart Grid (SG). As a backbone of C.I., Smart Grid demonstrates ability to precisely monitor large scale energy systems and designed in order to achieve complex local and global objectives. Being capable of performing such sophisticated operation it also bears the vulnerability of being exposed for cyber-physical co-ordinated attack that may lead to catastrophic effect. Many researchers have analyze the different stages of cyber-physical co-ordinated attacks like attack detection, prevention, impact analysis and recovery plans but there exist a research gap to address all the issues under single framework. Through this paper, we propose a novel Cyber Physical Defense Framework (CPDF) based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines to address the cyber attack on SG. Our work addresses the pre and post attack scenario, attack vector formulation through hierarchical PetriNet modeling and recovery mechanism. We have performed experiment for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and False Data Injection attack (FDI) to validate our framework effectiveness and established the efficacy of proposed model. In the end, we have presented a case study of FDI attack detection using machine learning technique on IEEE 9-bus and 14-bus system.	[Sinha, Ayush; Mohandas, Manasi; Vyas, O.

However, the vulnerability of ANN under certain attacks poses security threat for critical automation systems. Adding noises to artificial neural network has been shown to be able to improve robustness in previous work. In this work, we propose a new technique to compute the pathwise stochastic gradient estimate with respect to the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to each neuron of the ANN. By our proposed technique, the gradient estimation with respect to noise levels is a byproduct of the back propagation algorithm for estimating gradient with respect to synaptic weights in ANN. Thus, the noise level for each neuron can be optimized simultaneously in the processing of training the synaptic weights at nearly no extra computational cost. In numerical experiments, our proposed method can achieve significant performance improvement on robustness of several popular ANN structures under both black box and white box attacks.

Aiming to address the shortcomings of existing analytical approaches, i.e. single dimension and venerability to anti-reconnaissance, this paper adopts the Stacking, the ensemble learning algorithm, combines multiple modalities such as text, image and URL, and proposes a multimodal fraudulent website identification method by ensembling heterogeneous models. Cross-validation is first used in the training of multiple largely different base classifiers that are strong in learning, such as BERT model, residual neural network (ResNet) and logistic regression model. Classification of the text, image and URL features are then performed respectively. The results of the base classifiers are taken as the input of the meta-classifier, and the output of which is eventually used as the final identification. The study indicates that the fusion method is more effective in identifying fraudulent websites than the single-modal method, and the recall is increased by at least 1%. In addition, the deployment of the algorithm to the real Internet environment shows the improvement of the identification accuracy by at least 1.9% compared with other fusion methods.

Such attack has posed significant security threat to unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs), especially in the era of low-altitude economics. However, due to the similarity of the spoofing and intended signal, and the presence of noise, accurate detection and recognition of GPS spoofing attack still remains a challenging issue, particularly in the case of limited samples. In this article, we apply the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm, which combines multiple weak convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers into a strong classification model, to achieve GPS spoofing attack recognition. To further improve the recognition accuracy when there are very limited samples, we improve the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm by transferring previous network parameters to subsequent CNN. Both simulated and real measurement data are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is shown that the recognition accuracy can reach up to 93.75% and 95.83% with 160 simulated samples and 120 measured samples, respectively.

It assesses this cyber attack from the steady state and optimal scheduling point of view. In order to stop the cyber hacking, a new deep learning-based framework has been developed based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this framework, two networks compete with each other, wherein the first network generates fake data, and the second one is responsible for the data classification. In order to get into the most optimal features, a new optimization method based on a modified teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is also devised to reinforce the GAN model and help a better matching training process. In addition, a new modification is introduced for TLBO to avoid premature convergence and provide high population diversity. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a real dataset of several smart metering devices in a MG has been tested. Results illustrate the high performance of the proposed framework, comparing to the well-known conventional detection frameworks with hit rate of 93.11%, miss rate of 6.89%, false alarm rate of 7.76% and correct reject rate of 92.24%.

We start with the fundamental knowledge including what are adversarial examples, how to realize such attacks, and common defense methods. Adversarial training enhances models' resilience to adversarial attacks by taking both regular and adversarial examples for training. However, applying adversarial examples under a single adversarial strength provide defense in a very limited effective range. We propose a multiple-strength adversarial training method. A random walk algorithm is adopted to optimize the selection of adversarial strengths, which is closely related to the design cost and training time. We also analyze the hardware cost and quantization loss to guide future consumer electronics designs.

Existing methods aim to minimize perturbation values, use acoustic masking, or mimic environmental sounds to render them undetectable. However, these perturbations, being audible frequency range sounds, are still audibly detectable. The slow propagation and rapid attenuation of sound limit their temporal sensitivity and attack range. In this study, we propose LaserAdv, a method that employs lasers to launch adversarial attacks, thereby overcoming the aforementioned challenges due to the superior properties of lasers. In the presence of victim speech, laser adversarial perturbations are superimposed on the speech rather than simply drowning it out, so LaserAdv has higher attack efficiency and longer attack range than Light-Commands. LaserAdv introduces a selective amplitude enhancement method based on time-frequency interconversion (SAE-TFI) to deal with distortion. Meanwhile, to simultaneously achieve inaudible, targeted, universal, synchronizationfree (over 0.5 s), long-range, and black-box attacks in the physical world, we introduced a series of strategies into the objective function. Our experimental results show that a single perturbation can cause DeepSpeech, Whisper and iFlytek, to misinterpret any of the 12,260 voice commands as the target command with accuracy of up to 100%, 92% and 88%, respectively. The attack distance can be up to 120 m.

These platforms have become integrated into modern life, representing an important means of communication and information sharing. However, this widespread popularity has also drawn the attention of cybercriminals, who seek to exploit OSNs using deceptive Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as their weapons of choice. Conventional URL-classification methods, which rely on post-access features or static analysis, face significant limitations; they struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving tactics of cybercriminals, and they often lack the granularity required for precise URL categorization. The methodology proposed herein takes a different path, leveraging the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) in tandem with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract contextual embeddings from URLs. By combining the cutting-edge capabilities of ANNs and BERT, we introduce an efficient approach to safeguarding OSN users from the insidious threats lurking behind deceptive URLs by classifying them into five distinct categories: benign, defacement, phishing, malware, and spam. The proposed approach was found to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 98.0%, surpassing the previous best of 97.92%. This technique thus has the potential to serve as a crucial defense mechanism for the billions of individuals who rely on OSNs for their social and informational needs.

However, when a rule set is represented as a decision tree, some quirks in its structure may negatively affect its performance. For example, duplicate sub-trees and rule filters, that need to be evaluated more than once, could negatively affect the efficiency. This paper presents a novel algorithm based on Shannon's expansion, which guarantees that the same rule filter is not evaluated more than once, even if repeated in other rules. This fact increases efficiency during the evaluation process using the induced decision tree. Experiments demonstrated the viability of the proposed algorithm in processing-intensive scenarios, such as in intrusion detection and data stream analysis.

Smart grid cyberattack types classification: A fine tree bagging-based ensemble learning approach with feature selection	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS			English	Article						Cyberattack; Ensemble learning; Substation automation		This paper focuses on the detection and classification of the cyberattack types in smart grid substation automation systems. The previous work in the literature focuses only on the detection of the attacks without providing any information regarding the attack's type, which is a key in identifying the appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, a novel approach that uses a fine tree bagging ensemble learning technique is developed to detect and classify the cyberattack types from normal and power quality disturbances. Furthermore, the relevant features of different cyber-attack types such as message suppression, denial-of-service and data manipulation have been identified. The proposed approach is tested on a publicly available dataset and the results are compared to three other machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree, nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. The results have shown that the proposed approach is very effective in the detection and the classification of the attack types as well as it is insensitive to the selection of the training and the testing datasets unlike other existing approaches in the literature.

T<SUP>2</SUP>S<SUP>2</SUP>G: A Novel Two-Tier Secure Smart Grid Architecture to Protect Network Measurements	ENERGIES			English	Article						FDI attacks; power grid measurements; distributed state estimation; compromised meter; smart grid	FALSE DATA INJECTION; STATE ESTIMATION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; POWER-SYSTEMS; ATTACKS	False data injection (FDI) attacks are a major security threat to smart grid (SG) communication systems. In FDI attacks, the attacker has the ability of modifying the measurements transmitted by smart grid entities such as smart meters, buses, etc. Many solutions have been proposed to mitigate FDI attacks in the SG. However, most of these solutions rely on centralized state estimation (SE), which is computationally expensive. To engulf this problem in FDI attack detection and to improve security of SGs, this paper proposes novel two-tier secure smart grid (T(2)S(2)G) architecture with distributed SE. In T(2)S(2)G, measurement collection and SE are involved in first tier while compromised meter detection is involved in second tier. Initially the overall SG system is divided into four sections by the weighted quad tree (WQT) method. Each section is provided with an aggregator, which is responsible to perform SE. Measurements from power grids are collected by remote terminal units (RTUs) and encrypted using a parallel enhanced elliptic curve cryptography (PEECC) algorithm. Then the measurements are transmitted to the corresponding aggregator. Upon collected measurements, aggregator estimates state using the amended particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm in a distributed manner. To verify authenticity of aggregators, each aggregator is authenticated by a logical schedule based authentication (LSA) scheme at the control server (CS). In the CS, fuzzy with a neural network (FNN) algorithm is employed for measurements classification. Our proposed T(2)S(2)G shows promising results in the following performance metrics: Estimation error, number of protected measurements, detection probability, successful detection rate, and detection delay.

The majority of open-source host-based analytics are heuristic in nature and often rely on matching combinations of strings to produce an alert. Recent threat reports demonstrate that threat actors are able to easily evade these types of analytics via variances in attack techniques, implementation differences, or simple string/parameter modifications. This work introduces a novel machine learning-based approach (procmonML) to generate true behavioral host-based analytics that are more resilient to adversary evasion, thus imparting more workload on the adversary to successfully evade detection. This is accomplished by consolidating multiple system events into a single process event. Analytics are generated from a tree ensemble model using labeled host data from a lab environment and are validated on production enterprise endpoints. This approach can detect multiple variations of a single attack technique by capturing and generalizing system behaviors. The results demonstrate that the procmonML approach is able to effectively generate host-based analytics that are applicable to new environments and more resilient to adversary evasion.

ORCA: Outage Root Cause Analysis in DER-Rich Power Distribution System Using Data Fusion, Hierarchical Clustering and FP-Growth Rule Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Data integration; Sensors; Relays; Current measurement; Data mining; Root cause analysis; Voltage measurement; Outage management; root cause analysis; hybrid approach; machine learning; frequent pattern-growth; distribution system; distributed energy resources; D-PMU; data driven analysis	ONLINE DETECTION	Power outages have been an inevitable part of power delivery systems. In case of large scale outages with conflicting information in the distribution network with distributed energy resources (DER), recognition of the root causes becomes increasingly complex. Root cause detection is very important for routing the crew and for faster restoration. Number of studies have been conducted on analysis of the outages, planning predictive actions, and improving the restoration process for minimization of the load outages using various statistical and data processing. A comprehensive methodology with the ability to find root causes in quick and efficient manner is still missing. This work proposes an Outage Root Cause Analysis (ORCA) tool, with various internal modules. The proposed ORCA utilizes the available data from diverse set of sensors (Distribution Phasor Measurement Units, metering and relay) within the distribution system (DS) to: a) aggregate using data fusion algorithm: an Ensemble Extended Kalman Filter (EEKF) approach, b) classify events at broader level (fault, breaker operation or cyber-attack with/without load outage) using hierarchical agglomerative clustering in online and offline manners, and c) narrow down the outage root cause to the possible nuanced identified causes (vegetation, animal, weather, wildfire, protection, equipment failure, planned) using the available historical data and the Frequent Pattern-Growth data mining approach. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the other existing key approaches using two different test systems and multiple outage with different locations case scenarios.

Cyber attacks are persistently rising, detection of cyber crimes and providing preventive measures by manual investigation are often failed to control the cyber attacks. Therefore, machine learning plays a vital role in detecting those cybercrimes. It has the ability to detect and analyze the cyber attack and provides the preventive measures in order to reduce the incarnation of the cyber crimes. Therefore, incorporating machine learning techniques such as classification and clustering into our framework can help to build a cyber crime detection system and prediction of cyber attacks annually. Existing literature in the area of cybercrime offences by feature extraction focuses on several techniques. In this a novel framework for cybercrime offences by feature extractions is proposed. In this proposed framework one can upload any unstructured cyber crime report to generate the structure data through TFID technique. Later this framework can give a report on categorization and resolution of the cyber crime offences (especially ID theft, Hacking and Copyright attacks) by its severity and occurrence. It is achieved by extracting the feature description using text mining algorithms and by using the performance measurements and prediction analysis of cyber crime.	[Sudha, T.

J	Kumar, Y; Subba, B				Kumar, Yogendra; Subba, Basant			Stacking ensemble-based HIDS framework for detecting anomalous system processes in Windows based operating systems using multiple word embedding	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Host based Intrusion Detection; System(HIDS); Ensemble-based classifier; Word Embedding; Word2Vec & GloVe; ADFA-WD dataset	ALGORITHMS	Globally, more than 80% of end-user devices run on Microsoft's Windows-based operating systems. There-fore, majority of the cyber-attack payloads are crafted explicitly for exploiting various vulnerabilities that exist across different software modules of Windows-based operating systems. To address this security is-sue, a stacking ensemble-based HIDS framework for detecting anomalous system processes is proposed in this paper. The proposed HIDS framework analyzes the process files comprising sequence of dll in-struction calls made by various application and system processes to the Windows operating system's kernel for detecting anomalous processes. The framework initially transforms the system process files comprising sequence of dll invocations into their corresponding n-gram feature vectors. It then uses two different state-of-the-art word embedding techniques namely, Word2Vec and GloVe to learn the contex-tual inter-dependencies between n-gram terms of the feature vectors, and generate fixed length word embedding vectors for each n-gram terms. These learned numeric word embedding vectors along with the n-gram feature vectors corresponding to the system process files are then provided as input to train an ensemble-based classifier model comprising LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU and Bi-GRU based base-level classi-fiers, and a fully connected neural network based meta-level classifier for classification of system pro-cess files as either normal or anomalous. The proposed HIDS framework is capable of detecting wide range of Windows-based attacks with high accuracy and precision. Experimental results show that the proposed HIDS framework achieves high accuracy and precision of 91.00% and 93.30%, respectively on the benchmark binary class Australian Defense Force Academy Windows Dataset (ADFA-WD) dataset. It also achieves an accuracy and precision of 68.70% and 67.80%, respectively on the multi-class ADFA-WD dataset, which are significantly higher than other similar HIDS frameworks proposed in the literature.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This decreases the need for solutions that permit service delivery to operate in a highly resilient manner. This paper presents an architecture for a novel cloud platform designed for resilient service delivery. It supports networks where poor communication links or high node failure will cause services to be delivered in an nonresilient manner. This could be the result of factors such as high node mobility, poor environmental conditions, and unreliable infrastructure from environment disaster or cyber-attack. This biologically inspired architecture uses a purely distributed multiagent approach to provide self-healing and self-organizing properties, modeled on the characteristics of embryonic development and biological cell communication. To permit high levels of a node churn, this multiagent approach uses local-only communication. Probabilistic cellular automata are used to simulate this architecture and evaluate the efficacy of this approach.

J	Zhang, LB; Chen, S; Long, M; Cai, J				Zhang, Le-Bing; Chen, Song; Long, Min; Cai, Juan			Face de-morphing based on identity feature transfer	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						digital forensics; face recognition; image forensics; image restoration	ATTACK DETECTION; NETWORK	Face morphing attacks have emerged as a significant security threat, compromising the reliability of facial recognition systems. Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice's identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods.

Cyber Personhood	2021 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER CONFLICT, CYCON	International Conference on Cyber Conflict		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon) - Going Viral	MAY 25-28, 2021	Tallinn, ESTONIA			cyber personhood; environmental personhood; cyber attack; highly interdependent cyber systems		In early 2020, the rapid adoption of remote working and communications tools by governments, companies, and individuals around the world increased dependency on cyber infrastructure for the normal functioning of States, businesses, and societies. For some, the urgent need to communicate whilst safeguarding human life took priority over ensuring that these communications tools were secure and resilient. But as these tools become firmly embedded in everyday life worldwide, the question arises whether they should be considered as critical infrastructure, or perhaps even something more important. In a number of States, the critical importance of the environment for preservation of human life has been recognised by extending legal personhood - and thus, legal rights - to environmental entities. Countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, New Zealand, and India have granted legal rights to various rivers, lakes, parks, and nature in general. This paper explores the future possibility and cases where States may consider granting legal rights to other non-sentient but critically important entities. Looking into a future where human life becomes increasingly dependent upon highly interdependent systems in cyberspace, is there a possibility that these systems are granted personhood? Remote work and its cybersecurity implications could lead to an entirely new recognition of the importance of cyberspace dependencies and, consequently, a new legal treatment. Against the backdrop of extended debate on the legal regulation of cyberspace, including the law of armed conflict, this would raise even more complex legal considerations, especially in the light of cross-border dependencies and systems that affect multiple jurisdictions. By way of cyber biomimicry, this paper adopts a blue-sky conceptual approach to studying policy considerations and potential implications if highly interdependent cyber systems in the distant future are granted the same protections as elements of the environment.

Despite the efforts of current email filtering to keep up with the email-based threat vectors, unsolicited emails still keep reaching millions of targets. The current solutions are mainly focused on distinguishing ham from spam/phishing, leaving a gap in the identification and analysis of other unsolicited emails such as scams and adult content. In this paper, we present a study on the development of a more granular approach for sanitizing and categorizing unsolicited emails, specifically focusing on spam, phishing, scam and adult content. We design and evaluate a method for classifying unsolicited emails that can aid incident response teams in extracting contextual potential Threat Indicators (TIs). We train a machine learning language-agnostic classifier that achieves high accuracy with a novel set features such as attachments and TIs characteristics. Our results show that spam continues to drive a great portion of unsolicited emails together with phishing. Our analysis of URLs extracted from unsolicited emails revealed a surprising finding - over 80% of these TIs were not flagged as malicious by other threat feeds. This highlights the need for more effective methods of sharing malicious emails and their associated TIs.

And malware authors use policies like category disguise or family obfuscation in malware components to evade detection, which poses a great security threat to enterprises, government agencies, and Internet users. In this paper, we propose a malware family classification approach based on multimodal fusion and weight self-learning. Firstly, multiple modalities of malware such as byte, format, statistic, and semantic are fused in various ways to generate effective features. And then, we creatively add a weight self-learning mechanism of malware families into the classification model, which works by continuously calculating log-loss based on the family label and the probabilities predicted by each feature. The approach proves to achieve excellent classification performance on highly imbalanced malware family datasets with high efficiency and small resource overhead, which helps to identify and classify malware families and enhance the efficiency of massive malware analysis in Intelligent Transportation Systems.

However, there are two problems in the current schemes proposed, one is that the security threat of user's privacy disclosure for plaintext transmission, the other one is that attackers can infer the identities of the communication participants via signature correctness verification. For the problem mentioned above, we propose an identity-based one-off public key scheme for privacy preservation based on signcrytion algorithm. the scheme ensures that the confidentiality of the message, and only the specified verifier can verified the signature correctness. Furthermore, The scheme has lower computation and communication overhead compared with current available schemes.

Driving 2FA Adoption at Scale: Optimizing Two-Factor Authentication Notification Design Patterns	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM			English	Proceedings Paper	30th USENIX Security Symposium	AUG 11-13, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK					Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the primary mechanisms for defending end-user accounts against phishing and password reuse attacks. Unfortunately, getting users to adopt 2FA remains a difficult challenge. While prior work at the intersection of measurement and usability has examined how to persuade people to avoid dangerous behavior (e. g., clicking through TLS warnings), relatively little work has conducted measurements at industry scale about how to persuade people to adopt protective behaviors. In this work, we focus on improving end user security in the wild by examining whether (i) messaging that addresses users' motivations, mental models, and concerns about 2FA and (ii) UX design patterns found effective in other fields can effectively improve 2FA adoption. To do so, we conduct a series of large-scale in-the-wild, controlled messaging experiments on Facebook, with an average of 622; 419 participants per experiment. Based on our results, we distill a set of best-practice design patterns for most effectively encouraging protective behavior, in the context of promoting 2FA adoption. Finally, we suggest concrete directions for future work on encouraging digital security behavior through security prompts.

Reducing capital and operational expenditure to a great extent already drew attention of big companies and industries. Not only startups but also large existing giant companies are shifting their data from local server to a public cloud and sometimes even taking the initiative to build a public cloud to host their sensitive data. A cloud can provide storage services, computing services and also infrastructure without any capital or operational expenses. From a single user to a multi-national million-dollar business can easily receive several types of services from a public cloud. There are numerous cloud providers in the market. Among the prominent ones, few names are mentioned here, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure etc. GCP offers a wide array of services for many organizations and individuals around the world like other cloud providers. But the question is, all those data, confidential information, intellectual property of individual or industries safe enough? Information has become the most expensive commodity in modern days. A government can be shutdown, a transport system can be disabled, annoying spam calls, phishing emails, cyber bullying and more security threats are existing around us. Can we trust a public service provider? Hence our initiative aims at investigating that GCP is secure from inside attackers. Why we chose inside attackers? Well the idea is to check if GCP can detect and ignore an attack launched internally. In this case it should be secure enough to prevent from outsiders as well. The research investigation would involve Distributed Denial of Service (DD0S) attacks against a local virtual machine (VM) launched from GCP. There is a broad spectrum of VM's available in GCP compute engine service.

Spam problems and its influence on the society have been investigated and discussed from different perspectives. Several studies have looked into the influence of the spam on the economy, financial, marketing, business and management, while others deliberate the impact of the spam on the security and privacy. Subsequently, there are different anti-spam techniques that have spam filtering or blocking mechanisms. This work attempts to investigate an available anti-spam technology and highlight the possible improvements. Consequently, it constructs a new agent-based anti-spam model that can overcome some existing limitations. The Multi-Natural Language Anti-Spam (MNLAS) model comprises visual information, and texts of an email in the spam filtering process. The MNLAS is implemented in a Java environment using Jade agent platform. The application detects and filters spam emails of different types using a dataset of 200 emails.

An adversary can provide users with a model trained on poisoned data to manipulate prediction behavior in test stage using a backdoor. The backdoored models behave normally on clean images, yet can be activated and output incorrect prediction if the input is stamped with a specific trigger pattern. Most existing backdoor attacks focus on manually defining imperceptible triggers in input space without considering the abnormality of triggers' latent representations in the poisoned model. These attacks are susceptible to backdoor detection algorithms and even visual inspection. In this paper, We propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack - DEFEAT. It poisons the clean data using adaptive imperceptible perturbation and restricts latent representation during training process to strengthen our attack's stealthiness and resistance to defense algorithms. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple image classifiers using real-world datasets to demonstrate that our attack can I) hold against the state-of-the-art defenses, 2) deceive the victim model with high attack success without jeopardizing model utility, and 3) provide practical stealthiness on image data.

Most of the known vulnerabilities are already aggregated, stored in text format, and are readily accessible to the public, making such an aggregated database a prime corpus for analysis using data mining methods. A multitude of research efforts have been deployed analyzing individual aspects of such cyber-security corpora to create taxonomies, assess vulnerability impact, and even predict future vulnerabilities. However, minimal effort has been committed to analyze cyber-security corpora to explore correlations between vulnerabilities and study the evolution of a vulnerability from its genesis. In this paper, we propose an integrated data mining framework to automatically lay out how vulnerabilities develop over time and detect the evolution of a specific cyber-security threat. We use (1) a Supervised Topical Evolution Model (STEM), which discovers temporal themes from a text corpus and (2) a diffusion-based storytelling technique that sifts through past vulnerability reports to describe how a current threat evolved. The STEM gives a holistic evolution structure of the vulnerabilities, while diffusion-based storytelling provides the precise genealogy of a specific threat. A considerable series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can discover evolutionary patterns in today's most pressing vulnerabilities with a high degree of precision. As case studies, we explore the development of vulnerabilities in certain products, providing a unique insight into the correspondence between seemingly unrelated vulnerabilities and the impact of that correspondence on overall software security.

The unsupervised identification and characterization of malware samples has been primarily treated as an early integration, multi-modal clustering problem where all possible features derived from the samples are concatenated into one feature vector, which can then be fed into a standard unsupervised learning algorithm. In this work, we focus on characterizing malware samples into possible threat actors from both late integration and intermediate integration multi-modal data perspectives. In doing so, we propose a new algorithm, Cross-Modal Influence Clustering, for characterizing malware samples into threat actor groups. We test our proposed method along with several other multi-modal clustering techniques on heterogeneous malware samples from three different threat actors. Our results indicate that our proposed method is the best method for clustering malware samples into threat actors in an unsupervised setting and that we observe consistently better results in characterizing malware samples by threat actors from intermediate or late integration multi-modal paradigms rather than an early integration one.

However, this widespread integration of modern ICTs also brings significant security concerns, exposing the power grids to potential cyber-attacks. A load redistribution (LR) attack is a more realistic and practical type of generalized false data injection attack that can severely disrupt the secure and economic operation of the smart grid. Since their introduction in 2011, research into LR attacks has grown significantly over the last decade. As a result, LR attacks have evolved in terms of their attack models, objectives, impacts, and stealthiness. This review article aims to comprehensively analyze the advancements in LR attacks over the last decade, emphasizing their attack models, impact on the grid, and the defense mechanisms available against the LR attacks. This article also outlines the potential research gaps and presents future research directions in the field of LR attacks.

Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is an advanced form of ITS where diverse vehicle services are deployed on the roadside unit. V2I consists of distributed computing nodes where transport applications are parallel processed. Many research challenges exist in the presented V2I paradigms regarding security, cyber-attacks, and application processing among heterogeneous nodes. These cyber-attacks, Sybil attacks, and their attempts cause a lack of security and degrade the V2I performance in the presented paradigms. This paper presents a new secure blockchain framework that handles cyber-attacks, as mentioned earlier. This paper formulates this complex problem as a combinatorial problem, encompassing concave and convex problems. The convex function minimizes the given constraints, such as time and security risk, and the concave function improves performance and accuracy. Therefore, numerous constraints, such as time, energy, malware detection accuracy, and application deadlines, require optimization for the considered problem. Combining the jointly non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and long short -term memory (LSTM) schemes is the best way to meet the problem's limitations. In this study, the paper designed a malware dataset with known and unknown malware. The different kinds of malware lists (e.g., cyber-attacks) are considered in the form of known and unknown malware lists with the characteristics, size of code, where malware comes from, attack on which data, and current status of the workload after being attacked by the malware. Our main idea is to present blockchain, NSGA-II, and LSTM schemes that handle phishing, routing, Sybil, and 51% of cyber-attacks without compromising application performance. Simulation results show that the study reduces delay and energy, improves accuracy, and minimizes security risks for vehicular applications.

J	Yin, XF; Chen, YF				Yin, Xiufang; Chen, Yanfang			RETRACTED: Cyber Risk Recommendation System for Digital Education Management Platforms (Retracted Article)	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Retracted Publication								Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a new school and academic year for students in a distance learning regime. This new daily routine was unprecedented and undoubtedly unusual, especially for the younger ones. At this point and at these ages, the risk of cyber fraud is even greater. The transition from the physical environment to the Internet took place quickly without the appropriate time to control potential risks and the proper information and training of teachers and students. Some common threats that need to be addressed to protect learners and their data when using e-learning methods are malicious remote access, malware, phishing, cyber fraud, etc. Considering the above situation, this work presents an innovative cyber risk recommendation system for digital education management platforms. The system in question is a distributed two-stage algorithm based on game theory and machine learning, which is trained by the constant change in the choice of recommendations by users to maximize security. We examine the algorithm's ability to simulate a user system in which everyone independently selects a user recommendation, assesses the environment and the implications of this choice, and then concludes whether it will continue to have that recommendation fixed. The methodology with which we have represented the digital e-learning system has been done with an approach that directly corresponds with their general view as a cyber-physical-social system. We consider the digital school as an environment that brings limitations, leading us to a pretty demanding personalization problem. Users coexist in this environment, in which everyone acts voluntarily but influences and is influenced by the surrounding environment. Our results lead us to conclude that this algorithm responds in a fully effective, flexible, and efficient way to the needs of protection and risk assessment of e-learning education systems.

J	Deng, PF; Hong, SH; Qi, J; Wang, L; Sun, HX				Deng, Pengfei; Hong, Shaohua; Qi, Jie; Wang, Lin; Sun, Haixin			A Lightweight Transformer-Based Approach of Specific Emitter Identification for the Automatic Identification System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Transient analysis; Transformers; Steady-state; Logic gates; Radio transmitters; Automatic identification system; radio frequency fingerprints; specific emitter identification; Transformer	FREQUENCY FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION; RADIO; COMPLEX; NETWORKS	The automatic identification system (AIS) is the automatic tracking system for automatic traffic control and collision avoidance services, which plays an important role in maritime traffic safety. However, it faces a possible security threat when the maritime mobile service identity (MMSI) that specifies the vessels' identity in AIS is illegally counterfeited. To guarantee the communication security of AIS for preventing fraudulent devices, we design a novel lightweight Transformer-based network GLFormer for specific emitter identification (SEI) to provide an extra security layer for AIS terminal emitters. Concretely, the gated local attention unit (GLAU) and the gated sliding local attention unit (GSLAU) modules that combine a simplified gated attention unit (GAU) and a sliding local self-attention (SLA) are developed in GLFormer to extract the radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) features automatically from the raw in-phase signals. Especially, the simplified GAU focuses on more critical RFF features and filters out the irrelevant information from the raw signal to improve performance, which is also a single-head self-attention module with fewer parameters for lightweight. Meanwhile, the SLA limits self-attention operation to a window, introducing the inductive bias of local information to enhance performance further and reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linearity for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the GLFormer achieves 96.31% and 89.38% identification accuracy in the constructed AIS transient and AIS steady-state datasets with 50 vessels, respectively. The 99.90% identification accuracy is achieved in the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) dataset with ten devices. It is not only better than the existing methods but requires much fewer parameters and lower computational complexity; besides, it is also suitable for working with long signal sequences.

Although much research has been done on this topic, our study reveals that less attention is given to combatting the tactics used by spammers, like purposely forging spellings and the usage of smart sentence structuring. This work attempts to fill this void by using sub-wording and context-based methods. The sub-wording method is used to combat the usage of forged spellings while the context-based method is used to counter smart sentence structuring tactics used by spammers. Also, most of the prevalent methods have been evaluated only for one class weight. As the models' performance can vary over class weights, we have used two class weights i.e., balanced and unbalanced for evaluation. The proposed model is designed by using a multi-head approach integrated with the Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit network. The proposed model has been evaluated on the Lingspam and Spamtext datasets. Another issue neglected in prevalent methods is catastrophic forgetting, to consider it we have used a combination of the two datasets. The evaluation is done in terms of f1_score, accuracy, and receiver operator characteristic curve. The proposed model performs well, giving 99.75% accuracy for the Spamtext dataset and 99.79% accuracy for the Lingspam dataset. Obtained results are compared with state of art models available in the previous literature works.

These representations encode similarity structures that enable efficient learning of multiple downstream tasks. Recently, ML-as-a-Service providers have commenced offering trained SSL models over inference APIs, which transform user inputs into useful representations for a fee. However, the high cost involved to train these models and their exposure over APIs both make black-box extraction a realistic security threat. We thus explore model stealing attacks against SSL. Unlike traditional model extraction on classifiers that output labels, the victim models here output representations; these representations are of significantly higher dimensionality compared to the low-dimensional prediction scores output by classifiers. We construct several novel attacks and find that approaches that train directly on a victim's stolen representations are query efficient and enable high accuracy for downstream models. We then show that existing defenses against model extraction are inadequate and not easily retrofitted to the specificities of SSL.

Even though potential attacks against these learning algorithms may hijack their behavior, causing catastrophic loss in real-world applications, little is known about adversarial attacks on bandit algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework of offline attacks on bandit algorithms and study convex optimization based attacks on several popular bandit algorithms. We show that the attacker can force the bandit algorithm to pull a target arm with high probability by a slight manipulation of the rewards in the data. Then we study a form of online attacks on bandit algorithms and propose an adaptive attack strategy against any bandit algorithm without the knowledge of the bandit algorithm. Our adaptive attack strategy can hijack the behavior of the bandit algorithm to suffer a linear regret with only a logarithmic cost to the attacker. Our results demonstrate a significant security threat to stochastic bandits.

Randomness, rough knowledge, and vagueness lead us to uncertainty. In mathematics, the fuzzy set (FS) theory and logics are used to model uncertain events. This article defines a new concept of complex picture fuzzy relation (CPFR) in the field of FS theory. In addition, the types of CPFRs are also discussed to make the paper more fruitful. Today's complex network architecture faces the ever-changing threats. The cyber-attackers are always trying to discover, catch, and exploit the weaknesses in the networks. So, the security measures are essential to avoid and dismantle such threats. The CPFR has a vast structure composed of levels of membership, abstinence, and nonmembership which models uncertainty better than any other structures in the theory. Moreover, a CPFR has the ability to cope with multivariable problems. Therefore, this article proposes modeling techniques based on the complex picture fuzzy information which are used to study the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of different network securities against several threats and cyber-attack practices. Moreover, the strength and preeminence of the proposed methods are verified by studying their comparison with the existing methods.

J	Liu, YT; Gu, H; Qin, P				Liu, Yuting; Gu, Hong; Qin, Pan			Evaluating robustness of support vector machines with the Lagrangian dual approach	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Support vector machines; Adversarial robustness; Robustness verification; Lagrangian duality; Subgradient method		Adversarial examples bring a considerable security threat to support vector machines (SVMs), especially those used in safety-critical applications. Thus, robustness verification is an essential issue for SVMs, which can provide provable robustness against various adversarial attacks. The evaluation results obtained through robustness verification can provide a security guarantee for the use of SVMs. The existing verification method does not often perform well in verifying SVMs with nonlinear kernels. To this end, we propose a method to improve the verification performance for SVMs with nonlinear kernels. We first formalize the adversarial robustness evaluation of SVMs as an optimization problem with a feedforward neural network representation. Then, the lower bound of the original problem is obtained by solving the Lagrangian dual problem. Finally, the adversarial robustness of SVMs is evaluated concerning the lower bound. We evaluate the adversarial robustness of SVMs with linear and nonlinear kernels on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The experimental results show that our method achieves a higher percentage of provable robustness on the test set compared to the state-of-the-art.

The attacker gained entry into T-Mobile's systems through an unprotected router and used brute force techniques to access the sensitive information stored on the internal servers. The data stolen included names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, birthdays, driver's license numbers, ID information, IMEIs, and IMSIs. We analyze the data breach and how it opens the door to identity theft and many other forms of hacking such as SIM Hijacking. SIM Hijacking is a form of hacking in which bad actors can take control of a victim's phone number allowing them means to bypass additional safety measures currently in place to prevent fraud. This paper thoroughly reviews the attack methodology, impact, and attempts to provide an understanding of important measures and possible defense solutions against future attacks. We also detail other social engineering attacks that can be incurred from releasing the leaked data.

However, the development of quantum computing power poses a growing potential security threat to secure multi-party algorithms based on mathematically tricky problems, and most of the proposed quantum privacy comparison schemes could be more efficient. Therefore, based on the W-state, we offer a more efficient semi-quantum privacy comparison method. The security analysis shows that the scheme can resist third-party, measurement, and entanglement attacks.

The attacked model performs well on benign samples, whereas performs abnormally on backdoor samples. Current backdoor attacks usually inject static trigger into benign samples, which can be easily detected with static trigger patterns and large perturbation. In this brief, inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we proposed a backdoor attack against radio signals modulation based on adaptive trigger (AT-GAN) to learn the patterns of adaptive trigger, which can generate different trigger for specific radio signal. AT-GAN is composed of Adaptive Backdoor Generate Network (A-BaN), discriminator and radio signals modulation model. A-BaN is trained to generate adaptive triggers, discriminator is used to limit the perturbation of triggers and modulation model is poisoned based on generated poisoned samples. By a three-player game, A-BaN can generate adaptive triggers with small perturbation. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve better attack performance and reduce the detection rate of backdoor attacks compared to baseline backdoor attacks.

The adaptations include multigraph port numbering, ego IDs, and reverse message passing. We prove that the combination of these theoretically enables the detection of any directed sub-graph pattern. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptations in practice, we conduct experiments on synthetic subgraph detection tasks, which demonstrate outstanding performance with almost perfect results. Moreover, we apply our proposed adaptations to two financial crime analysis tasks. We observe dramatic improvements in detecting money laundering transactions, improving the minority-class F1 score of a standard message-passing GNN by up to 30%, and closely matching or outperforming tree-based and GNN baselines. Similarly impressive results are observed on a real-world phishing detection dataset, boosting three standard GNNs' F1 scores by around 15% and outperforming all baselines.

In order to promote the safe and reliable application of the modulation recognition intelligent model, it is necessary to study its adversarial defense technology. An adversarial defense method based on ensemble learning for modulation signal intelligent recognition model is proposed in this paper. Specifically, this method is achieved by combining multiple defense models such as adversarial training, defensive distillation, and noise smoothing. Variety of attack algorithms in both the white-box and black-box scenarios under different intensities of perturbation and different signal-to-noise ratios are carried out to verify the robustness performance of the proposed method.

ML-based Data Anomaly Mitigation and Cyber-Power Transmission Resiliency Analysis	2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR SMART GRIDS, SMARTGRIDCOMM			English	Proceedings Paper	2020 International Conference on Communications Control and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids	NOV 11-13, 2020	Tempe, AZ			Visualization tool; grid resiliency; cyber-attacks; cyber-physical systems		In recent years, the cyber and physical extreme events have increased and impacted the power system operations. Although there are multiple work reported for improving the resiliency of the power grid systems, there are a limited number of resiliency management tools available to the grid operators. Addressing the data quality issue is critical before feeding the measurements for situational awareness and decision-making using resiliency management tools. In this work, we describe an automated ML-based measurement data anomaly mitigation technique that uses regression, clustering, deep learning techniques as a base detector. Maximum Likelihood Criterion (MLE) based ensemble of these base detectors helps in anomaly detection and mitigation using SyncAED tool and feeding data for enhanced resiliency using a tool: Cyber-Physical Transmission Resiliency Assessment Metric (CP-TRAM). CP-TRAM utilizes real-time power grid data and aims to assist operators in measuring resiliency and ensuring the energy supply to critical loads given a cyber-attack or a natural disaster. This paper discusses the multiple ML algorithms for data anomaly detection, the basis of software design considerations, open-source software components, and use cases for the prototype developed tools.

Anonymization, encryption, and routing protocol constitute the existing prevalent privacy -preserving approaches, most of which have successfully implemented the privacy preservation of data query, data mining and data aggregation. Nevertheless, there has been a gradual switch in the selection of privacy -preserving technology. Predictive game -theoretic analytics for privacy preservation in IoT networks has received significant attention since it can effectively settle the conflicts between attackers and defenders. In this survey, we explain the basics of various games mainly applied for IoT privacy preservation, such as simultaneous game, stochastic game, bargain game, differential game, mean field game, aggregation game, Stackelberg game, signaling game, repeated game, evolutionary game, and cooperative game. We then explore different applications for game theory -based privacy preservation in IoT networks, followed by discussing the differences among the existing solution of privacy -preserving issues using different games under specific IoT scenarios. Moreover, we consider the challenges and outline future research directions. In conclusion, this survey not only presents existing work on applying game theory to preserve privacy in current IoT networks including smart grids, intelligent transportation systems, crowdsensing, edge -based IoT, integrated energy systems, blockchain IoT, Social IoT and Industrial IoT, but it also encourages researches to further dig deeper into rare areas.

We describe the main idea of our proposed Block Access Restriction (BAR) mechanism, which controls the actual block requests and detects malicious behaviors while transactions have been recorded into a specific block, to protect general miner's privileges and provide fairness in the blockchain network environment. We propose an effective way to prevent this to happen (with detailed steps), discuss how to deploy BAR switch into blockchain networks and how the BAR switch can prevent DSA while the hacker bypasses it. We also present general idea of implementing BAR switch, and point out the importance of dealing with security threat at post-quantum computing era.

The federal learning (FL) framework-based modulation recognition (MR) is an essential component, but its use of uninterpretable deep learning (DL) introduces security risks. This article combines traditional signal interference methods and data poisoning in FL to propose a new adversarial attack approach. The poisoning attack in distributed frameworks manipulates the global model by controlling malicious users, which is not only covert but also highly impactful. The carefully designed pseudo-noise in MR is also extremely difficult to detect. The combination of these two techniques can generate a greater security threat. We have further advanced our proposal with the introduction of the new adversarial attack method called "chaotic poisoning attack" to reduce the recognition accuracy of the FL-based MR system. We establish effective attack conditions, and simulation results demonstrate that our method can cause a decrease of approximately 80% in the accuracy of the local model under weak perturbations and a decrease of around 20% in the accuracy of the global model. Compared to white-box attack methods, our method exhibits superior performance and transferability.

Drive-by-download attacks make use of exploit codes to take control of user's web browser. Many web users do not take such underlying threats into account while clicking URLs. URL Blacklist is one of the practical approaches to thwarting browser-targeted attacks. However, URL Blacklist cannot cope with previously unseen malicious URLs. Therefore, to make a URL blacklist effective, it is crucial to keep the URLs updated. Given these observations, we propose a framework called automatic blacklist generator (AutoBLG) that automates the collection of new malicious URLs by starting from a given existing URL blacklist. The primary mechanism of AutoBLG is expanding the search space of web pages while reducing the amount of URLs to be analyzed by applying several pre-filters such as similarity search to accelerate the process of generating blacklists. AutoBLG consists of three primary components: URL expansion, URL filtration, and URL verification. Through extensive analysis using a high-performance web client honeypot, we demonstrate that AutoBLG can successfully discover new and previously unknown drive-by-download URLs from the vast web space.

Due to their fast-growing number and increasing complexity, automated analysis methods are preferred by security analysts over manual ones. The automated dynamic analysis of malware executes the samples in controlled environments and monitors their potentially malicious behavior. Modern malware can detect these emulated or virtualized environments and suspend their malicious activities to foil the analysis. Consequently, the ultimate technique for analyzing the behavior of malware is through execution of the samples in bare metal analysis environments. Detection aside, restoring the analysis system to a clean state after each analysis is challenging. To resolve this, in this paper we propose an FPGA-implemented storage mirroring technique for instantaneous restoration of the storage device and the retrieval of the files having been modified during the sample execution.

This research article aims to propose an effective design technique for IDS with regard to online applications. We develop a new set of features based on time-frequency analytics that makes use of 2-D models of monetary operations for preventing money laundering systems. As a classification algorithm, random forest is used, and clustering algorithm is used to tune the hyperparameters. Our findings imply that bitcoin exchanges would behave in an excessive reporting manner more than private banks under this law. We specifically take into account the monetary operations as a digital signal and attempt to build a classifier using a collection of frequently mined rules. Our tests on a replicated transaction dataset based on actual banking operations demonstrate the effectiveness of our suggested approach.

To manage the data collected and sampled by medical devices, traditional centralized data management will lead to attacks such as single point of failure, which pose a security threat. Aiming at the problems of low data trust and uncontrolled data sharing in telemedicine, we proposed blockchain-based secure medical data management and disease prediction. To securely manage healthcare data, we carefully designed three-tier architecture. Specifically, in the user sensor layer, medical sensors monitor the patient status in real-time. In the storage layer, to protect the privacy of patients, we stored their data in blocks and quantified the medical data by using information entropy technology. In addition, in the blockchain layer, we also used smart contracts for application, authorization, and access control of health data to eliminate privacy leaks caused by internal and external security risks. The information summary is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of backtracking and anti-repudiation. We designed an extensible machine learning algorithm to predict disease types using a disease prediction model algorithm based on transfer learning. Security analysis and numerical results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively manage the safety data of telemedicine and predict the patient's future condition.

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of deep learning based crowd counting models to backdoor attacks, a major security threat to deep learning. A backdoor attack implants a backdoor trigger into a target model via data poisoning so as to control the model's predictions at test time. Different from image classification models on which most of existing backdoor attacks have been developed and tested, crowd counting models are regression models that output multi-dimensional density maps, thus requiring different techniques to manipulate. In this paper, we propose two novel Density Manipulation Backdoor Attacks (DMBA- and DMBA+) to attack the model to produce arbitrarily large or small density estimations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DMBA attacks on five classic crowd counting models and four types of datasets. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the unique challenges of backdooring crowd counting models and reveal two key elements of effective attacks: 1) full and dense triggers and 2) manipulation of the ground truth counts or density maps. Our work could help evaluate the vulnerability of crowd counting models to potential backdoor attacks.

A maximum correntropy criterion unscented Kalman filter based on Cauchy kernel function (CK-MCC-UKF) is designed against FDIAs and non-Gaussian noises. Meanwhile, pseudo-random numbers are applied as data watermarking for secure transmission and attack detection. To further improve the accuracy of the state estimation, an order insensitive sequential fast covariance intersection (SFCI) algorithm is applied for the fusion of local estimates. Finally, numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed.

Although federated learning (FL) has promoted distributed collaborative learning while keeping natural compliance with the privacy protection, it is tremendously difficult to schedule edge nodes of CEI collaboratively when asynchronous FL tasks are applied in CEI system, since the CEI system must make an irrevocable immediate decision on whether to hire a participant who arrives and departs dynamically without knowing future information. In this article, we tackle this issue by designing fairness-aware and time-sensitive task allocation mechanisms in asynchronous FL for CEI. First, we design an optimal multidimensional contract to guarantee the reliability, honesty, and fairness, and maximize the learning accuracy for the fixed deadline scenario. Second, we design a multimetric participant recruitment mechanism to control time consumption for the limited budget scenario, prove that the problem of optimizing this mechanism is NP-hard, and propose an e-approximation algorithm accordingly. Finally, extensive experiments using both real-world data and simulated data further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Several systems of botnet detection have been done by using a machine learning method with feature selection approach. Currently, the creation of dataset feature based on network flow, Domain Name System (DNS) traffic and content based that represent botnet behavior. Unfortunately the dataset for botnet detection is dummy dataset, to implement in machine learning needs extractor tool which is very expensive to buy. Therefore we create our own features extractor. In this paper we propose network flow using connection logs approach on the dataset. First of all we made the data model using pair of source IP (Internet Protocol), destination IP and source port, destination port in a period time to extract new features. To predict the accuracy, the extracted features will be validated using K-Fold Cross Validation with number of k=10. The results of the validation with six various types of botnet shows the high Precision=98.70%, F-Measure=99.40%, Recall=98.80%, and Accuracy=98.80% for Rule Induction algorithm, while K-Nearest Neighbor is the most stable than all algorithms that achieve precision, Recall, Fmeasure and accuracy to 98.10% and high speed (50 ms).

Like this, as the number of messenger users increased, malware attacks targeting messenger has been increasing. In this paper, we propose the Integrated Messenger Anti-virus System (IMAS) that utilizes chatbot service to predictively detect malware attacks targeting at a messenger. The IMAS integrates various messenger's chatbot into a single form of Adapter so that it can support any messengers and contains multi anti-virus scanner in charge of detection of malware, so users can check detection results in real-time. Also, we implement a real environment based on the proposed design and present the result of detecting suspected malware by using various messenger chatbots.

It has been demonstrated that adversaries who make small changes to the training set, such as adding specially crafted data points, can hurt the performance of the output model. Some of the stronger poisoning attacks require the full knowledge of the training data. This leaves open the possibility of achieving the same attack results using poisoning attacks that do not have the full knowledge of the clean training set. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of the problem above. Specifically, for the case of feature selection with LASSO, we show that full information adversaries (that craft poisoning examples based on the rest of the training data) are provably stronger than the optimal attacker that is oblivious to the training set yet has access to the distribution of the data. Our separation result shows that the two setting of data-aware and data-oblivious are fundamentally different and we cannot hope to always achieve the same attack or defense results in these scenarios.

J	Yin, XN; Zheng, XX				Yin, Xiaona; Zheng, Xingxing			A Semisupervised Majority Weighted Vote Antiphishing Attacks IDS for the Education Industry	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article								Although the digital transformation is advancing, a significant portion of the population in all countries of the world is not familiar with the technological means that allow malicious users to deceive them and gain great financial benefits using phishing techniques. Phishing is an act of deception of Internet users. The perpetrator pretends to be a credible entity, abusing the lack of protection provided by electronic tools and the ignorance of the victim (user) to illegally obtain personal information, such as bank account codes and sensitive private data. One of the most common targets for digital phishing attacks is the education sector, as distance learning became necessary for billions of students worldwide during the pandemic. Many educational institutions were forced to transition to the digital environment with minimal or no preparation. This paper presents a semisupervised majority-weighted vote system for detecting phishing attacks in a unique case study for the education sector. A realistic majority weighted vote scheme is used to optimize learning ability in selecting the most appropriate classifier, which proves to be exceptionally reliable in complex decision-making environments. In particular, the voting naive Bayes positive algorithm is presented, which offers an innovative approach to the probabilistic part-supervised learning process, which accurately predicts the class of test snapshots using prerated training snapshots only from the positive class examples.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a key component in autonomous driving, which is also increasingly adopted in pervasive computing such as smartphones, wearable devices, and IoT networks. Prior work shows CNN-based classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, it is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense techniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four defense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to classification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should be taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively defend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate protection against all five attacks. We derive several implications for system and middleware builders: (1) when adding a defense component against adversarial attacks, it is important to deploy multiple defense methods in tandem to achieve a good coverage of various attacks, (2) a black-box attack is much less effective compared with a white-box attack, implying that it is important to keep model details (e.g., model architecture, hyperparameters) confidential via model obfuscation, and (3) driving models with a complex architecture are preferred if computing resources permit as they are more resilient to adversarial attacks than simple models.

They operate independently as small-scale energy networks using distributed energy resources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and poor power quality are essential operational problems that must be mitigated to improve the MG's performance. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced heuristic optimization mechanisms for MGs. However, local minima and the inability to find a global minimum in heuristic methods create errors in non-linear and nonconvex optimization, posing challenges in dealing with several operational aspects of MG such as energy management optimization, cost-effective dispatch, dependability, storage sizing, cyber-attack minimization, and grid integration. These challenges affect MG's performance by adding complexity to the management of storage capacity, cost minimization, reliability assurance, and balance of renewable sources, which accelerates the need for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (MHOAs). This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of MHOAs and their role in improving the operational performance of MGs. Firstly, the fundamentals of MG optimization are discussed to explore the scopes, requisites, and opportunities of MHOAs in MG networks. Secondly, several MHOAs in the MG domain are described, and their recent trends in MG's techno-economic analysis, load forecasting, resiliency improvement, control operation, fault diagnosis, and energy management are summarized. The summary reveals that nearly 25% of the research in these areas utilizes the particle swarm optimization method, while the genetic and grey wolf algorithms are utilized by nearly 10% and 5% of the works studied in this paper, respectively, for optimizing the MG's performance. This result summarizes that MHOA presents a system-agnostic optimization approach, offering a new avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of future MGs. Finally, we highlight some challenges that emerge during the integration of MHOAs into MGs, potentially motivating researchers to conduct further studies in this area.

With the increasing amount of the surveillance videos, high computation and storage costs have posed a great challenge for the resource-constrained users. In recent years, the cloud storage services have made a large volume of video data outsourcing become possible. However, person Re-ID over outsourced surveillance videos could lead to a security threat, i.e., the privacy leakage of the innocent person in these videos. Therefore, we propose an efFicient privAcy-preseRving peRson Re-ID Scheme (FARRIS) over outsourced surveillance videos, which can ensure the privacy of the detected person while providing the person Re-ID service. Specifically, FARRIS exploits the convolutional neural network (CNN) and kernels based supervised hashing (KSH) to extract the efficient person Re-ID feature. Then, we design a secret sharing based Hamming distance computation protocol to allow cloud servers to calculate similarities among obfuscated feature indexes. Furthermore, a dual Merkle hash trees based verification is proposed, which permits users to validate the correctness of the matching results. The extensive experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that FARRIS can work efficiently, without compromising the privacy of the involved person.

The Impact of US Cyber Policies on Cyber-Attacks Trend	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS: CYBERSECURITY AND BIG DATA			English	Proceedings Paper	14th IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics - Cybersecurity and Big Data (IEEE ISI)	SEP 28-30, 2016	Tucson, AZ					There is a general belief that cyber attacks on the United States are increasing, as indicated by the 30% increase in cyber-attack related news from 2014 to 2015. During the same time frame, however, the USA government enacted several policy measures meant to reduce or mitigate cyber-attacks. These recent developments have lead us to ask two questions, a) Have cyber-attacks on the United States actually increased, as perceived in the news media? b) What is the impact of changes in US cyber-policy on this trend in cyber-attacks? Our initial investigation reveals that in contrast to the perception, there has been a drop in the number of DDoS cyber-attacks on the USA. In this research, we compare the perceptions and the reality of cyber attacks by considering recent trends in cyber-related news and cyber-attacks (specifically DDoS type attacks). The analysis makes three important contributions: a) Using GDelt data, we show that from 2014 to 2015 the amount of news referring to cyber events have increased, but the sentiment expressed in such news has become more negative. b) Using DDoS-attacks data shared by Arbor Network, we show that from 2014 to 2016, there has been a marked decrease in the number of cyber-attacks on the USA. c) Using a time series intervention analysis, we show that the decline in cyber-attacks appears to be related to the changes in US cyber policy. In particular, the US President's authorization to prosecute malicious cyber actors significantly decreased the DDoS-attacks on the US.

Since those applications require a large amount of computation for processing the sensed data, it is essential to offload the computation load to the edge computing (EC) server. In this paper, we propose the sensing and computing decision (SCD) algorithms for data freshness in the EC-enabled wireless sensor networks. We define the $\eta $ -coverage probability to show the probability of maintaining fresh data for more than $\eta $ ratio of the network, where the spatial-temporal correlation of information is considered. We then propose the probability-based SCD for the single pre-charged sensor case with providing the optimal point after deriving the $\eta $ -coverage probability. We also propose the reinforcement learning (RL)-based SCD by training the SCD policy of sensors for both the single pre-charged and multiple energy harvesting (EH) sensor cases, to make a real-time decision based on its observation. Our simulation results verify the performance of the proposed algorithms under various environment settings, and show that the RL-based SCD algorithm achieves higher performance compared to baseline algorithms for both the single pre-charged sensor and multiple EH sensor cases.

J	Naderi, E; Asrari, A				Naderi, Ehsan; Asrari, Arash			Experimental Validation of a Remedial Action via Hardware-in-the-Loop System Against Cyberattacks Targeting a Lab-Scale PV/Wind Microgrid	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Microgrids; Computer crime; Sensors; Intelligent sensors; Smart grids; Sensor systems; Power system stability; Cyber-physical system; detection; distributed generation; false data injection (FDI) attack; hardware-in-the-loop (HIL); remedial action scheme (RAS); smart microgrid	DATA INJECTION ATTACKS; FALSE-DATA; DC MICROGRIDS; CYBER-ATTACK; MITIGATION; STRATEGY; POWER	This paper experimentally validates the effectiveness of a primary/backup framework in preventing/mitigating the impacts of false data injection (FDI) cyberattacks targeting a lab-scale wind/photovoltaic (PV) microgrid. As the primary mechanism, an artificial intelligence-based false data detection algorithm is proposed to forecast the upcoming measurements and alert the operator about the accuracy of sensors ’ readings, directly collected from the field devices. Given that some FDI attacks are designed to bypass the utilized detection methods, it is essential to be prepared for such circumstances. Hence, as the backup mechanism, a remedial action scheme (RAS) is also introduced to mitigate the impacts of such malicious cyberattacks and keep the functionality of the microgrid. The proposed framework (i.e., FDI model, detection approach, and remedial action scheme) is developed as a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed within the cyber-physical structure of the smart microgrid. The experimental results validate 1) the negative impacts of modeled FDI attacks on the lab-scale microgrid, 2) the effectiveness of the developed false data detection technique, and 3) the efficiency of the proposed RAS to keep the normal operation of the targeted microgrid when the detection system fails to recognize the attack.

With the increasing rise of cyber attacks and fraud, new security models are needed that ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of financial transactions. The identified gap lies in the inability of traditional authentication methods, such as TANs and tokens, to provide security in untrusted terminals. The proposed solution is the Dynamic Authorization Protocol (DAP), which uses mobile devices to validate transactions through visual codes, such as QR codes. Each transaction is assigned a unique associated code, and the challenge must be responded to within 120 s. The customer initiates the transaction on a computer and independently validates it on their mobile device using an out-of-band channel to prevent attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle. The methodology involves implementing a prototype in Java ME for Android devices and a Java application server, creating a practical, low-computational-cost system, accessible for use across different operating systems and devices. The protocol was tested in real-world scenarios, focusing on ensuring transaction integrity and authenticity. The results show a successful implementation at Banco do Brasil, with 3.6 million active users, demonstrating the efficiency of the model over 12 years of use without significant vulnerabilities. The DAP protocol provides a robust and effective solution for securing banking transactions and can be extended to other authentication environments, such as payment terminals and point of sale devices.

Darknet monitoring, which constantly observes packets sent from malware-infected hosts to unused IP address space, has been proven effective for countermeasuring indiscriminate cyber-threats. In this paper, we presents a new machine learning scheme to track attack activities and evolving process of infected devices observed on the darknet. First, we perform feature extraction using FastText to explore the underlying correlation between targeted network services as indicated by the destination ports of scanning packets. Then, we employ a nonlinear dimension reduction technique, UMAP, to project hosts into a 2-D embedding space for a visualization purpose. Finally, we perform clustering analysis based on DBSCAN to automatically identify groups of infected hosts with similar attack behaviors. In the experiments, we use a one-month darknet traffic trace collected from a/16 darknet sensor to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. We show that groups of Mirai variants, potentially infected by the same botnets, can be successfully detected by the proposed approach. In particular, a Mirai variant targeting vulnerabilities on TCP port 9530 are newly discovered during the observation period.

Subsequently, the voice commands directed at these devices contain a wealth of private information, encompassing users' daily routines, details about clinic visits, and even shopping habits. Security researchers have already identified vulnerabilities in encrypted network traffic, particularly in the context of traffic analysis, enabling the network-level adversaries to infer the websites visited by users. This security threat, common in traditional web communication, extends to voice query communication between the smart speaker and the server, giving rise to the concept of Voice Command Traffic Fingerprinting (VCF). In this paper, building upon recent literature on VCF, we strive to conduct a more comprehensive study. Our contributions include proposing a variant of WF features that empowers adversaries to outperform state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we consider variations in voice command traffic influenced by factors such as device locations and user characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a command category fingerprinting approach capable of inferring the voice command category even for unknown commands, presenting a more practical and scalable model. Through these contributions, we aim to advance the understanding of VCF by considering various practical factors influencing voice command traffic, and provide insights for the development of more robust defenses.

With the continuous expansion of the scale of the network, the difficulty of penetration testing increases sharply, and at the same time, it relies heavily on expert experience. Therefore, AI-based techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) will bean effective solution to automate penetration testing and reduce labor costs. However, in the existing DRL-based PT work, the attacker has a large number of low feedback behaviors, and it is difficult to collect enough successful experiences and positive learning rewards, that is, the sparse reward problem. In addition, existing works on automatic penetration based on MSF in real environments mainly focus on single-host scenarios and have not been extended to multi-host networks. In this paper, we propose anew intelligent PT framework "HER-PT"that integrates Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) techniques into DRL-based PT models in the hope of solving sparse reward problems in reinforcement learning and applying penetration testing to real multi-host scenarios. We constructed several network scenarios, trained HER-PT model agents in the cyber attack simulator Nasim for autonomous penetration testing experiments, and tried different reinforcement learning optimization schemes. Experimental results show that HER-PT can converge within 500 episodes in a medium scenario of 16 hosts, which is about 50% faster than other models. It can still maintain a success rate of 85.76% in the medium frequency dynamic change scene. The results show that HER-PT can effectively accelerate the training of the model and shorten the training period.

Chrome Extension For Malicious URLs detection in Social Media Applications Using Artificial Neural Networks And Long Short Term Memory Networks	2018 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATICS (ICACCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	SEP 19-22, 2018	Bangalore, INDIA					Social media applications have become an integral part of our life, business and society today. Due to their increasing number of users and growing popularity, many organisations use them as a medium to generate income. The businesses use social media analytics and advertisements to increase their revenue. Although social media applications were initially built to connect people across the globe, they have now turned into one of the most favoured ways of propagation of cyber crimes. Most users lack cyber awareness and fall prey to the malicious activities distributed via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and advertisements. When a user visits the malicious URL, it makes the hackers privy to a lot of personal and sensitive information of the user. To overcome the problem of malicious URLs victimising users we propose a tool deployed as a chrome extension. This tool, analyses URLs and classifies them using two different neural networks, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks which is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The major objective of the proposed model is to aid the users to avoid becoming a victim of malicious and fraudulent activities like malicious URLs, phishing and social engineering that favour social media as their target medium by detecting them accurately. The model proposed is scalable, easy to train and compatible with devices of varied hardware specifications. The proposed model gives excellent accuracy and overcomes several issues faced by the existing systems.

Despite their high accuracy on pristine data, it is well-known that digital manipulations, such as face morphing, pose a security threat to face recognition systems. Malicious actors can exploit the facilities offered by the identity document issuance process to obtain identity documents containing morphed images. Thus, subjects who contributed to the creation of the morphed image can with high probability use the identity document to bypass automated face recognition systems. In recent years, no-reference (i.e., single image) and differential morphing attack detectors have been proposed to tackle this risk. These systems are typically evaluated in isolation from the face recognition system that they have to operate jointly with and do not consider the face recognition process. Contrary to most existing works, we present a novel method for adapting deep learning-based face recognition systems to be more robust against face morphing attacks. To this end, we introduce TetraLoss, a novel loss function that learns to separate morphed face images from its contributing subjects in the embedding space while still achieving high biometric verification performance. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the original system while also significantly outperforming other tested baseline methods.

A description of the internal mechanisms of backdoored language models and how they process trigger inputs, e.g., when switching to toxic language, has yet to be found. In this work, we study the internal representations of transformer-based backdoored language models and determine early-layer MLP modules as most important for the backdoor mechanism in combination with the initial embedding projection. We use this knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered replacements that reduce the MLP module outputs to essentials for the backdoor mechanism. To this end, we introduce PCP ablation, where we replace transformer modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their activations. We demonstrate our results on backdoored toy, backdoored large, and non-backdoored open-source models. We show that we can improve the backdoor robustness of large language models by locally constraining individual modules during fine-tuning on potentially poisonous data sets. Trigger warning: Offensive language.

This paper demonstrates that DNNs also bring a new security threat, leading to the leakage of label information of input instances for the DNN models. In particular, we leverage the cache-based side-channel attack (SCA), i.e., Flush+Reload on the DNN (victim) models, to observe the execution of computation graphs, and create a database of them for building a classifier that the attacker can use to decide the label information of (unknown) input instances for victim models. Then we deploy the cache-based SCA on the same host machine with victim models and deduce the labels with the attacker's classification model to compromise the privacy and confidentiality of victim models. We explore different settings and classification techniques to achieve a high attack success rate of stealing label information from the victim models. Additionally, we consider two attacking scenarios: binary attacking identifies specific sensitive labels and others while multi-class attacking targets recognize all classes victim DNNs provide. Last, we implement the attack on both static DNN models with identical architectures for all inputs and dynamic DNN models with an adaptation of architectures for different inputs to demonstrate the vast existence of the proposed attack, including DenseNet 121, DenseNet 169, VGG 16, VGG 19, MobileNet v1, and MobileNet v2. Our experiment exhibits that MobileNet v1 is the most vulnerable one with 99% and 75.6% attacking success rates for binary and multi-class attacking scenarios, respectively.

Without doubt these criminal acts endanger the privacy of many users and businesses'. Several research initiatives have taken place to address the issue with no complete solution until now; and we believe an intelligent and automated methodology should be the way forward to tackle the challenges. However, till date limited studies have been conducted on the applications of purely unsupervised frameworks and algorithms in tackling the problem. To explore and investigate the possibilities, we intend to propose an anti-spam framework that fully relies on unsupervised methodologies through a multi-algorithm clustering approach. This article presents an in-depth analysis on the methodologies of the first component of the framework, examining only the domain and header related information found in email headers. A novel method of feature reduction using an ensemble of 'unsupervised' feature selection algorithms has also been investigated in this study. In addition, a comprehensive novel dataset of 100,000 records of ham and spam emails has been developed and used as the data source. Key findings are summarized as follows: I) out of six different clustering algorithms used - Spectral and K-means demonstrated acceptable performance while OPTICS projected the optimum clustering with an average of 3.5% better efficiency than Spectral and K-means, validated through a range of validations processes II) The other three algorithms- BIRCH, HDBSCAN and K-modes, did not fare well enough. III) The average balanced accuracy for the optimum three algorithms has been found to be approximate to 94.91%, and IV) The proposed feature reduction framework achieved its goal with high confidence.

The Impact of ChatGPT on English Language Teaching, Learning, and Assessment: A Rapid Review of Literature	ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL			English	Review						ChatGPT in English language teaching (ELT); ChatGPT and language assessment; generative Artificial Intelligence; impact of ChatGPT on L2 learning; issues of ChatGPT		This study aimed to explore the impact of ChatGPT on English language teaching, learning, and assessment. Specifically, it aimed to answer the following questions: 1) How can ChatGPT enhance English language learning, teaching, and assessment? and 2) What are the issues associated with ChatGPT in terms of language teaching, learning, and assessment? Utilizing Rapid Literature Review as a methodology guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this study found that ChatGPT can support and enhance English language learning by providing meaning-focused inputs, offering scaffoldings during the production of meaning -focused outputs, giving feedback on the accuracy of learners' language outputs, and facilitating fluency development through extensive language practice. Moreover, this study also found that ChatGPT can enhance English language teaching by assisting teachers in designing bespoke lesson plans, facilitating language learning inside and outside language classrooms, developing customized instructional materials, assessing L2 learning, and giving immediate, individualized feedback. However, despite the benefits it can provide to English language teachers and learners, its use in the classroom is faced with many issues such as inaccurate responses, academic dishonesty and plagiarism, skills deterioration, generic responses, inherent biases, privacy breaches, non-emotionality, technical limitations, educational inequity, and teacher job security threat. Detailed results and implications for policymaking and language teacher development are discussed.

In the work, we explore the space formed by the pixel values of all possible backdoor triggers. An original trigger used by an attacker to build the backdoored model represents only a point in the space. It then will be generalized into a distribution of valid triggers, all of which can influence the backdoored model. Thus, previous methods that model only one point of the trigger distribution is not sufficient. Getting the entire trigger distribution, e.g., via generative modeling, is a key of effective defense. However, existing generative modeling techniques for image generation are not applicable to the backdoor scenario as the trigger distribution is completely unknown. In this work, we propose max-entropy staircase approximator (MESA) for high-dimensional sampling-free generative modeling and use it to recover the trigger distribution. We also develop a defense technique to remove the triggers from the backdoored model. Our experiments on Cifar10/100 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MESA in modeling the trigger distribution and the robustness of the proposed defense method.

The data stored in blockchain can be considered as big data - massive-volume, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Due to highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in blockchains. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available blockchain data to reveal insights into its business transactions and for critical downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, phishing scams and counterfeit token detection. In this tutorial, we discuss relevant literature on blockchain data structures, storage, categories, data extraction and graphs construction, graph mining, topological data analysis, and machine learning methods used, target applications, and the new insights revealed by them, aiming towards providing a clear view of unified graph-data models for UTXO and account-based blockchains. We also emphasize future research directions.

Machine learning techniques are effective, but current methods such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB) sometimes produce low detection rates and struggle with large amounts of data. Motivated by these concerns, we propose an efficient spamfiltering approach, OAOS-LR, combining an improved Atomic Orbital Search (AOS) algorithm with an LR classification model. To remove the deficiency of low detection rate produced by the standard LR method due to the utilization of the gradient descent technique, we train it with our proposed OAOS approach, which uses AOS and Orthogonal learning to enhance the search capabilities of the conventional algorithm. In the experimental study, we first evaluated the performance of OAOS over the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC'20) benchmarks against five different metaheuristics to prove its effectiveness in improving its convergence rate and reducing the probability of falling in local optima. After that, the proposed technique LR-OAOS was applied to the spam filtering problem using CSDMC2010 and Enron datasets and tested against the most recent machine learning and metaheuristic approaches using standard statistical measures and plots. OAOS-LR significantly outperformed other methods with an average F1-score success rate of 95.45% and 96.30% on CSDMC2010, and 74.80% and 78.33% on Enron, respectively with the number of feature spaces equal to 500 and 1000.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

It is a challenging task as attacker uses different obfuscation and deception techniques to hide its identity. After an attack has occurred, digital forensic investigation is conducted to collect evidence from network/system logs. After investigation and collecting evidence reports are published in multiple formats such as text and PDF. There is no standard format for publishing these reports, so extracting meaningful information from these reports is a challenging task. Manual extraction of features from unstructured cyber-threat intelli-gence (CTI) is a difficult task. There is a need for an automated mechanism to extract features from unstructured reports and attribute cyber-threat actor (CTA). The aim of this research is to develop a mechanism to attribute or profile cyber threat actors (CTA) by extracting features from CTI reports. Moreover define a methodology to extract features from unstructured CTI reports by using natural lan-guage processing (NLP) techniques and then attributing cyber threat actor by using machine learning algorithms. Extracting features i.e., tactics, techniques, tools, malware, target organization/country and application by using novel embedding model known as" Attack2vec" which is trained on domain specific embeddings. Training model on domain specific embedding produces high results as compared to model train on general embeddings specially in the field of cyber security. Results of this novel model is com-pared with different methods. Machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine is used for classification of CTA. This novel model produces high results as compared to other models with Accuracy of 96%, Precision of 96.4%, Recall of 95.58% and F1-measure of 95.75%.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

Recent research has shown the possibility of deriving private speech information from sound-induced vibrations. Acoustic signals transmitted through a solid medium or air may induce vibrations upon solid surfaces, which can be picked up by various sensors (e.g., motion sensors, highspeed cameras and lasers), without using a microphone. To date, these threats are limited to scenarios where the sensor is in contact with the vibration surface or at least in the visual line-of-sight. In this paper, we revisit this important line of research and show that a remote, long-distance, and even thru-the-wall speech eavesdropping attack is possible. We discover a new form of speech eavesdropping attack that remotely elicits speech from minute surface vibrations upon common room objects (e.g., paper bags, plastic storage bin) via mmWave sensing, signal processing, and advanced deep learning techniques. While mmWave signals have high sensitivity for vibrations, they have limited sensing distance and normally do not penetrate through walls. We overcome this key challenge through designing and implementing a high-resolution software-defined phased-MIMO radar that integrates transmit beamforming, virtual array, and receive beamforming. The proposed system enhances sensing directivity by focusing all the mmWave beams toward a target room object, allowing mmWave signals to pick up minute speech-induced vibrations from a long distance and even through walls. To realize the attack, we design an object identification technique that scans objects in a room and identifies a prominent object that is most sensitive to speech vibrations for vibration feature extraction. We successfully demonstrate speech privacy leakage using speech-induced vibrations via the development of a deep learning framework. Our framework can leverage domain adaptation techniques to infer speech content based only on the unlabeled vibration data of a victim. We validate the proof-of-concept attack on digit recognition through extensive experiments, involving 40 speakers, five common room objects, and attack scenarios with mmWave devices inside and outside the room. Our phased-MIMO-based attack can achieve success rates of 88% similar to 98% and 64% similar to 86% with and without using speech labels for training. The success rates are 81% similar to 94% and 58% similar to 74% for thru-the-wall attacks. Furthermore, we discuss possible defense methods to mitigate this unprecedented security threat.

Chiefly, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a challenging task in such systems. It refers to blindly identifying the modulation type by a CR receiver which is highly recommended for military as well as civil applications, e.g. security, threat analysis. In this letter, a comprehensive testbed is provided. It aims at assessing the AMR performance in near real-world multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication scenario, as a first step for industrial integration and commercialization. Our testbed is based on the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology where the radio reconfigurability feature is warranted by integrating the NI-2954R Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) reconfigurable I/O (RIO) boards. The different processing modules of the designed testbed have been implemented within a scalable and flexible architecture to realize real-time recognition. It also serves as an efficient tool to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Empirical results showed that the proposed testbed yields high recognition accuracy and strong robustness.

Recent research on deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender systems have made significant progress in improving prediction accuracy, largely attributed to the widely accessible large-scale user data. Such data is commonly collected from users' personal devices and then centrally stored in the cloud server to facilitate model training. However, with the rising public concerns on user privacy leakage in online platforms, online users are becoming increasingly anxious over abuses of user privacy. Therefore, it is urgent and beneficial to develop a recommender system that can achieve both high prediction accuracy and strong privacy protection. To this end, we propose a DNN-based recommendation model called PrivRec running on the decentralized federated learning (FL) environment, which ensures that a user's data is fully retained on her/his personal device while contributing to training an accurate model. On the other hand, to better embrace the data heterogeneity (e.g., users' data vary in scale and quality significantly) in FL, we innovatively introduce a first-order meta-learning method that enables fast on-device personalization with only a few data points. Furthermore, to defend against potential malicious participants that pose serious security threat to other users, we further develop a user-level differentially private model, namely DP-PrivRec, so attackers are unable to identify any arbitrary user from the trained model. To compensate for the loss by adding noise during model updates, we introduce a two-stage training approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets in a simulated FL environment, and the results validate the superiority of both PrivRec and DP-PrivRec.

Owing to their complexity, a lot of research focuses on testing and debugging concurrent programs. Besides correctness, we find that security can also be compromised by concurrency. In this article, we present concurrent program spectre (ConcSpectre), a new security threat that hides malware in nondeterministic thread interleavings. To demonstrate such threat, we have developed a stealth malware technique called concurrent logic bomb by partitioning a piece of malicious code and injecting its components separately into a concurrent program. The malicious behavior can be triggered by certain thread interleavings that rarely happen (e.g., $<$1%) under a normal execution environment. However, with a new technique called controllable probabilistic activation, we can activate such ConcSpectre malware with a very high probability (e.g., $>$90%) by remotely disturbing thread scheduling. In the evaluation, more than 1000 ConcSpectre samples are generated, which bypassed most of the antivirus engines in VirusTotal and four well-known online dynamic malware analysis systems. We also demonstrate how to remotely trigger a ConcSpectre sample on a web server and control its activation probability.

Additionally, the focus has been on a narrow set of problems: phishing, spam and bullying. In this work, we seek to understand review fraud on e-commerce platforms through an HCI lens. Through surveys with real fraudsters (N=36 agents and N=38 reviewers), we uncover sophisticated recruitment, execution, and reporting mechanisms fraudsters use to scale their operation while resisting takedown attempts, including the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. We fnd that countermeasures that crack down on communication channels through which these services operate are efective in combating incentivized reviews. This research sheds light on the complex landscape of incentivized reviews, providing insights into the mechanics of underground services and their resilience to removal eforts.

J	Liu, JQ; Zhang, C; Fang, YG				Liu, Jianqing; Zhang, Chi; Fang, Yuguang			EPIC: A Differential Privacy Framework to Defend Smart Homes Against Internet Traffic Analysis	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bayesian inference; differential privacy; energy efficiency; Internet of Things (IoT); secure routing; traffic analysis attack	THINGS	The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.

J	Chen, ZJ; Zhou, Q; Liu, YJ; Luo, WJ				Chen, Zhijian; Zhou, Qi; Liu, Yujiang; Luo, Wenjian			A comprehensive transplanting of black-box adversarial attacks from multi-class to multi-label models	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep neural networks; Multi-label classification; Adversarial examples; Black-box attack		Adversarial examples generated by perturbing raw data with carefully designed, imperceptible noise have emerged as a primary security threat to artificial intelligence systems. In particular, black-box adversarial attack algorithms, which only rely on model input and output to generate adversarial examples, are easy to implement in real scenarios. However, previous research on black-box attacks has primarily focused on multi-class classification models, with relatively few studies on black-box attack algorithms for multi-label classification models. Multi-label classification models exhibit significant differences from multi-class classification models in terms of structure and output. The former can assign multiple labels to a single sample, with these labels often exhibiting correlations, while the latter classifies a sample as the class with the highest confidence. Therefore, existing multi-class attack algorithms cannot directly attack multi-label classification models. In this paper, we study the transplantation methods of multi-class black-box attack algorithms to multi-label classification models and propose the multi-label versions for eight classic black-box attack algorithms, which include three score-based attacks and five decision-based (label-only) attacks, for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the transplanted black-box attack algorithms demonstrate effective attack performance across various attack types, except for extreme attacks. Especially, most transplanted attack algorithms achieve more than 60% success rate on the ML-GCN model and more than 30% on the ML-LIW model under the hiding all attack type. However, the performance of these transplanted attack algorithms shows variation among different attack types due to the correlations between labels.

Using an initial seed of 22 blacklists, covering the period from January 2007 to June 2017, we collect more than 51 million mal-activity reports involving 662K unique IP addresses worldwide. Leveraging the Wayback Machine, antivirus (AV) tool reports and several additional public datasets (e.g., BGP Route Views and Internet registries) we enrich the data with historical meta-information including geo-locations (countries), autonomous system (AS) numbers and types of mal-activity. Furthermore, we use the initially labelled dataset of approximate to 1.57 million mal-activities (obtained from public blacklists) to train a machine learning classifier to classify the remaining unlabeled dataset of approximate to 44 million mal-activities obtained through additional sources. We make our unique collected dataset (and scripts used) publicly available for further research. The main contributions of the paper are a novel means of report collection, with a machine learning approach to classify reported activities, characterization of the dataset and, most importantly, temporal analysis of mal-activity reporting behavior. Inspired by P2P behavior modeling, our analysis shows that some classes of mal-activities (e.g., phishing) and a small number of mal-activity sources are persistent, suggesting that either blacklist-based prevention systems are ineffective or have unreasonably long update periods. Our analysis also indicates that resources can be better utilized by focusing on heavy mal-activity contributors, which constitute the bulk of mal-activities.

A T-S fuzzy discrete complex network model following piecewise homogeneous Markov process is constructed on the basis of the study of Markov jump models with aligned times. The combined effects of spoofing attacks and denial of service attacks are considered when processing controller signals. By analyzing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with dual modal correlation, we establish sufficient conditions for finite time boundedness of the synchronization error system, and then verify the controller's effectiveness in the attacked Lorenz chaotic system.

These key actors in the Ethereum interact with each other via transactions and contract calls. Given the highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in Ethereum blockchain. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available Ethereum blockchain data to reveal insights into its transactions and for important downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, address clustering, phishing scams and counterfeit tokens detection. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey of the existing literature. We categorize them based on publication years, venues, core ranking, and authors' affiliations, data usage and graphs construction, graph mining and machine learning techniques employed, and the new insights derived by them. We conclude by discussing our recommendations on the future work. Our article will be useful to data scientists, researchers, financial analysts, and blockchain enthusiasts.

Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) for mitigating Spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack in Cognitive Radio Networks	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING RESEARCH (ICCIC)	IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research		English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (IEEE ICCIC)	DEC 14-16, 2017	Tamilnadu Coll Engn, Coimbatore, INDIA		Tamilnadu Coll Engn	Collaborative Spectrum Sensing; Cognitive Radio network; Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification attack; Fuzzy Clustering means; Fusion Centre		Individual sensing was favoured by Collaborative Spectrum sensing (CSS) in Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), since it helps to obtain more accurate sensing decision. In centralized CRN, each node transports its local sensing data to the fusion center build it's the final decision. The Fusion Center decision plays a vital role. Attackers may try to handle the decision-making of the Fusion Center (FC) for selfish rationale or to interfere with the primary user transmission. This paper concentrates on one specific security threat in CRN called Byzantine attack. Also, known as Spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack. In SSDF attack, harmful users try to control the FC by sending fake sensing report. It plays a vital role in De-centralized network, where the attack resilience has been increased. The mitigation is free-based on fuzzy clustering algorithm. Fuzzy Clustering means (FCM) are proposed to mitigate the malicious user behavior than heretofore existing methods. The proposed approach improves the packet delivery ratio much larger than the preceding methods. The result has been taken in the time of packet transfer from one node to another node. The proposed research has been simulated in the Network Simulator software of Version 3. Robustness of this approach was favoured by simulation results.	[Magdalene, A.

Threat actors usually abuse the Domain Name System (DNS) to lure users to be victims of malicious domains hosting drive-by-download malware, botnets, phishing websites, or spam messages. Each year, many large corporations are impacted by these threats, resulting in huge financial losses in a single attack. Thus, detecting and classifying a malicious domain in a timely manner is essential. Previously, filtering the domains against blacklists was the only way to detect malicious domains, however, this approach was unable to detect newly generated domains. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have helped to enhance the detection capability of domain vetting systems. A solid feature engineering mechanism plays a pivotal role in boosting the performance of any ML model. Therefore, we have extracted effective and practical features from DNS traffic categorizing them into three groups of lexical-based, DNS statistical-based, and third party-based features. Third party features are biographical information about a specific domain extracted from third party APIs. The benign to malicious domain ratio is also critical to simulate the real-world scheme where approximately 99% of the traffic is devoted to benign. In this paper, we generate and release a large DNS features dataset of 400,000 benign and 13,011 malicious samples processed from a million benign and 51,453 known- malicious domains from publicly available datasets. The malicious samples span between three categories of spam, phishing, and malware. Our dataset, namely CIC-Bell-DNS2021 replicates the real-world scenarios with frequent benign traffic and diverse malicious domain types. We train and validate a classification model that, unlike previous works that focus on binary detection, detects the type of the attack, i.e., spam, phishing, and malware. Classification performance of various ML algorithms on our generated dataset proves the effectiveness of our model, where we achieved the best results for k- Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) with 94.8% and 99.4% Fl-Score for balanced data ratio (60/40%) and imbalanced data ratio (97/3%), respectively. Finally, we have gone through feature evaluation using information gain analysis to get the merits of each feature in each category, proving the third party features as the most influential one among the top 13 features.

The healthcare data management system records patient's data in different formats such as text, numeric, pictures and videos leading to data which is big and unstructured. Also, hospitals may have several branches in different geographical locations. Sometimes, for research purposes, there is a need to integrate patients' health data stored at different locations. In view of this, a cloud-based healthcare management system can be an effective solution for efficient health care data management. But the major concern of cloud-based healthcare system is the security aspect. It includes theft of identity, tax fraudulence, bank fraud, insurance frauds, medical frauds and defamation of high profile patients. Hence, a secure data access and retrieval is needed in order to provide security of critical medical records in healthcare management system. Biometric based authentication mechanism is suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations of token theft and forgetting passwords in the conventional token id-password mechanism used for providing security. It also has high accuracy rate for secure data access and retrieval. In the present paper, a cloud-based system for management of healthcare data BAMHealthCloud is proposed, which ensures the security of e-medical data access through a behavioral biometric signature-based authentication. Training of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performed in parallel on Hadoop MapReduce framework using Resilient Backpropagation neural network. From rigorous experiments, it can be concluded that it achieves a speedup of 9 times, Equal error rate (EER) of 0.12, the sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.95. Performance comparison of the system with other state-of-art-algorithms shows that the proposed system preforms better than the existing systems in literature. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, different entities in the intelligent transportation system (e.g., vehicles, infrastructure, traffic management centers, etc.) get connected with each other, thus making the entire system smarter, faster, and more efficient. However, these advances also bring significant challenges to public authorities, industry, as well as scientific communities. In terms of system design and control, current cloud and edge architecture of CAVs need to be refined or even redesigned to better function under uncertainties in demand, and to better cooperate with existing conventional vehicles and infrastructure. From the performance assessment perspective, models and simulation tools based on artificial intelligence and big data have been widely developed for validation and evaluation of cloud computing and edge computing, but the validity of these models needs to be re-examined with field implementations. Finally, while the increasing connectivity among vehicles and infrastructures may help improve their perception of the environment and enable coordinated decision making, it also presents new challenges to ensure system safety and security, with inherent disturbances to wireless communication networks and also the inevitably larger attack surface that may be exploited by malicious attacks. In this tutorial, experts from academia and industry will introduce the trends and challenges of applying cloud and edge computing for CAVs, highlight representative works in the literature and discuss their limitations, present new promising solutions, and outline future directions in research and engineering. Particular focus will be given to methodologies and tools for building digital twin frameworks with cloud and edge computing for CAVs, quantitative and formal analysis for ensuring CAV safety under disturbances and uncertainties, system-level CAV security threat landscape and defense solution space, and experiences from practical deployment of cloud and edge computing for CAVs.

J	Angbera, A; Chan, HY				Angbera, Ature; Chan, Huah Yong			An adaptive XGBoost-based optimized sliding window for concept drift handling in non-stationary spatiotemporal data streams classifications	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Concept drift; Machine learning; Sliding windows; Spatiotemporal data streams; Bayesian optimization		In recent years, the popularity of using data science for decision-making has grown significantly. This rise in popularity has led to a significant learning challenge known as concept drifting, primarily due to the increasing use of spatial and temporal data streaming applications. Concept drift can have highly negative consequences, leading to the degradation of models used in these applications. A new model called BOASWIN-XGBoost (Bayesian Optimized Adaptive Sliding Window and XGBoost) has been introduced in this work to handle concept drift. This model is designed explicitly for classifying streaming data and comprises three main procedures: pre-processing, concept drift detection, and classification. The BOASWIN-XGBoost model utilizes a method called Bayesian-Optimized Adaptive Sliding Window (BOASWIN) to identify the presence of concept drift in the streaming data. Additionally, it employs an optimized XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model for classification purposes. The hyperparameter tuning approach known as BO-TPE (Bayesian Optimization with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) is employed to fine-tune the XGBoost model's parameters, thus enhancing the classifier's performance. Seven streaming datasets were used to evaluate the proposed approach's performance, including Agrawal_a, Agrawal_g, SEA_a, SEA_g, Hyperplane, Phishing, and Weather. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested model achieves impressive accuracy values of 70.83%, 71.02%, 76.76%, 76.96%, 84.26%, 95.53%, and 78.35% on the corresponding datasets, affirming its superior performance in handling concept drift and classifying streaming data.

Foresight can be defined as a component of strategic counterinsurgency operation with many benefits. Typically social settings of counterinsurgency operation are turbulent, complex and in some cases chaotic. Foresight should be linked to social practices of counterinsurgency agencies. In chaotic and emergent conditions, possibilities of foresight analyses are limited. This is why foresight analyses should be applied in such way that they enable proactive actions. Early warning systems and foresight diagnoses, prognoses and prescriptions should serve directly expected phases of counterinsurgency operations (pre-operation phase, operation phase and phase after counterinsurgency operation). If stakeholders want to develop effective early warning systems in relation to lone wolf challenge, it requires updated information of psychological and sociological behavior patterns of potential lone wolves. Early warning systems (and also weak signal systems) should be tailored to identify and recognize alarming psychological and social signals of potential lone wolf activities. In general, mass counterinsurgency attacks are problematic because larger trauma behavior (with terror behavior) can be expected to happen. In this conceptual study, alternative eight patterns of lone-wolf terrorism will be presented. These identified patterns are based on morphological analysis. To understand lone wolf phenomenon, we need more empirical research about these alternative psychological and socio-cognitive patterns. Concerning terror intelligence challenges, we can note that probably the pattern where terror attack is solo, non-directional and not ideologically motivated is the most challenging pattern of lone world terror phenomenon. On the other hand, the social pattern where terror attack is not solo, and it is directional, clearly rationally motivated and also ideologically motivated is the easiest lone wolf pattern to be observed before the attack happens. If we are able to contextualize the lone wolf phenomenon and identify facilitation channels and causal qualities of lone wolf behavior, it is possible to development effective counter operations of lone wolf terror. Other social patterns of lone wolf terror are more or less complex issues to be observed beforehand. Understanding lone wolf terror and explaining causal and complex relationships of lone wolf phenomenon need more research in the future. Especially supportive incentive mechanisms of lone wolf terror (ideological support, operational support and psychological support) need more scientific attention. Issues of anti-fragility, resilience, flexibility, adaptability, artificial intelligence support, and weak signal sensors are going to be critical challenges in the global battle against lone wolf terrorism.

Banks have implemented various user authentication methods to protect their customers' online accounts. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art user authentication methods used in online banking and potential cyber threats. This paper starts by exploring different user authentication methods, such as knowledge-based authentication (KBA), biometrics-based authentication (BBA), possession-based authentication (PBA), and other methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each user authentication method are then discussed. Furthermore, the paper discusses the various cyber threats that can compromise user authentication for online banking systems, such as malware attacks, social engineering, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, session hijacking, weak passwords, keyloggers, SQL injection, and replay attacks. Also, the paper explores the user authentication methods used by popular banks, which can provide insights into best practices for safeguarding online banking accounts and future user authentication methods in online banking and cyber threats. It states that the increasing use of BBA, two-factor authentication (2FA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) will help improve the security of online banking systems. However, the paper also warns that new cyber challenges will emerge, and banks need to be vigilant in protecting their customers' online banking accounts.

Improving ANiTW Performance Using Bigrams Character Encoding and Identity-Based Signature	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Watermarking; Social networking (online); Encoding; Phishing; Machine learning algorithms; Fake news; Text recognition; Steganography; Information integrity; Text watermarking; ID-based signature; source authentication; steganography; text integrity	SECURITY; ISSUES	Several threats, such as misinformation and hoax, exist in social media as a frequently used technology to exchange information. These threats can be prevented if the reader can verify the message's content integrity and source authenticity. One recent solution to overcome these threats was proposed by Ahvanooey et al. called ANiTW. ANiTW uses an invisible text watermarking scheme to verify social media message integrity and identify the message source. However, ANiTW is still vulnerable to undetected malicious text modification. Moreover, ANiTW has no tools to authenticate the extracted message source. The proposed method aims to overcome those vulnerabilities and improve ANiTW performance as a tool to verify message content integrity and message source authenticity in social media. To overcome vulnerabilities in ANITW, a part of the message hash and IBS-based signature is introduced as the watermark. The message integrity is verifiable by using part of the message hash as a watermark to detect any malicious. Moreover, implementing an IBS-based signature enables any reader to verify the message source's authenticity easily. In addition, to improve ANITW performance in embedding capacity and invisibility, a novel bigram-based character encoding and embedding rule are also introduced. Based on the experiment and analysis result, it is proven that the proposed method can perform better than ANiTW in the security, embedding capacity, and invisibility aspects.

In this paper, we propose a novel cyber-attack failure propagation model in smart grids. Our realistic failure propagation model addresses the system's heterogeneity by assigning different roles to its components. We define rules for and interdependencies of failure propagation and propose a new approach to studying cascading failures. In addition, our graph model identifies the most-vulnerable nodes. The model implements power flow analysis to guarantee that all transmission lines work below capacity and remove lines exceeding capacity. The model also considers that control packets could encounter different delays regarding the communication network structure and investigates the impact of communication delay on the failure of power components. Our results establish that by considering both power and communication characteristics and interdependencies, cascading failures can be modeled more accurately. We show that when we run the power flow analysis, there are a negligible number of failed nodes, which means that our model accurately identifies system failures.

In response, backdoor sample purification has emerged as a promising defense mechanism, aiming to eliminate backdoor triggers while preserving the integrity of the clean content in the samples. However, existing approaches have been predominantly focused on the word space, which are ineffective against feature-space triggers and significantly impair performance on clean data. To address this, we introduce a universal backdoor defense that purifies backdoor samples in the activation space by drawing abnormal activations towards optimized minimum clean activation distribution intervals. The advantages of our approach are twofold: (1) By operating in the activation space, our method captures from surface-level information like words to higher-level semantic concepts such as syntax, thus counteracting diverse triggers; (2) the fine-grained continuous nature of the activation space allows for more precise preservation of clean content while removing triggers. Furthermore, we propose a detection module based on statistical information of abnormal activations, to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and defending performance. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and against diverse attacks (including syntax and style attacks) demonstrate that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance.(1)	[Yi, Biao; Li, Tong; Zhang, Baolei; Liu, Zheli] Nankai Univ, Coll Cyber Sci, Key Lab Data & Intelligent Syst Secur, Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sishuo] Peking Univ, Ctr Data Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yiming] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore	Nankai University; Peking University; Nanyang Technological University	Li, T (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Coll Cyber Sci, Key Lab Data & Intelligent Syst Secur, Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.	yibiao@mail.nankai.edu.cn; chensishuo@pku.edu.cn; liyiming.tech@gmail.com; tongli@nankai.edu.cn; zhangbaolei@mail.nankai.edu.cn; liuzheli@nankai.edu.cn	Li, Yiming/ADL-5470-2022		National Natural Science Foundation of China [62272251]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.62272251).

Unfortunately, attackers also use this as an opportunity to trick victims through fake profiles that imitate official brand accounts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of such brand impersonation attacks on social media. We analyze the fake profile creation and user engagement processes on X, Instagram, Telegram, and YouTube and quantify their impact. Between May and October 2023, we collected 1.3 million user profiles, 33 million posts, and publicly available profile metadata, wherein we found 349,411 squatted accounts targeting 2,625 of 2,847 major international brands. Analyzing profile engagement and user creation techniques, we show that squatting profiles persistently perform various novel attacks in addition to classic abuse such as social engineering, phishing, and copyright infringement. By sharing our findings with the top 100 brands and collaborating with one of them, we further validate the real-world implications of such abuse. Our research highlights a weakness in the ability of social media platforms to protect brands and users from attacks based on username squatting. Alongside strategies such as customer education and clear indicators of trust, our detection model can be used by platforms as a countermeasure to proactively detect abusive accounts.

Cyber crime investigation conducted by network forensic professionals is critical not only to discover the source of security attacks but also to prevent future crimes. Although colleges and universities start involving forensics in education programs and forensics professionals training based on well-designed and effective curricula, there is still a significant gap between the supply of qualified network forensics professionals and what the market demands. As a highly technical subject, network forensics requires practitioners to obtain necessary knowledge and skills through both theoretical learning hands-on labs. However, survey of existing curricula shows the lack of hands-on network forensics labs. Therefore, we aim to develop a suite of initial hands-on network forensics labs that can be easily integrated into a Network Forensics course. The design focuses on addressing two major issues, building an isolated lab environment from the existing campus network and creating labs that provide realistic and practical experiences. In this paper, we first discuss the challenges of developing network forensics labs, then we describe our approaches to overcome those challenges. In addition, we also present the design of three typical network forensics labs. We believe that our designed labs, as well as the lessons learned, can help other institutions to develop effective network forensics courses.

The attacker injects the backdoor into the 3D model by poisoning a few training samples with trigger, such that the backdoored model performs well on clean samples but behaves maliciously when the trigger pattern appears. Existing attacks often insert some additional points into the point cloud as the trigger, or utilize a linear transformation (e.g., rotation) to construct the poisoned point cloud. However, the effects of these poisoned samples are likely to be weakened or even eliminated by some commonly used pre-processing techniques for 3D point cloud, e.g., outlier removal or rotation augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and robust backdoor attack (IRBA) to tackle this challenge. We utilize a nonlinear and local transformation, called weighted local transformation (WLT), to construct poisoned samples with unique transformations. As there are several hyper-parameters and randomness in WLT, it is difficult to produce two similar transformations. Consequently, poisoned samples with unique transformations are likely to be resistant to aforementioned pre-processing techniques. Besides, the distortion caused by a fixed WLT is both controllable and smooth, resulting in the generated poisoned samples that are imperceptible to human inspection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four models show that IRBA achieves 80%+ attack success rate (ASR) in most cases even with pre-processing techniques, which is significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art attacks.

These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for freeform human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking.

However, the works assume no common vulnerabilities among diverse variants, which is not always satisfied in the real world. In this letter, we consider that some variants have common vulnerabilities and propose the common vulnerability-aware diverse variant placement problem. We formulate the problem as an integer programming optimization problem with NP-hard complexity based on a new metric named the Infected Ratio Expectation. Furthermore, we devise algorithms to solve the problem for the static network and the network for extension. The simulation results show that compared with the baseline algorithms, our algorithms effectively restrain the worm spread by about 42%.

Existing studies often overlook the challenges posed by the acknowledgment signal's potential risks and the asymptotic convergence properties of stable systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving optimal transmission scheduling method based on a pre-arranged indicator. The method determines whether to transmit real state estimates or artificial noise by solving an optimization problem that balances estimation performance and privacy preservation. The privacy is ensured by keeping the eavesdropper's estimation error covariance higher than the legitimate estimator's. A threshold structure is proved with theoretical derivations. Simulation results are given to support the theoretical analysis.

J	Chen, YF; Yang, YZ				Chen, Yanfang; Yang, Yongzhao			An Advanced Deep Attention Collaborative Mechanism for Secure Educational Email Services	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MODEL	The COVID-19 crisis has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities of some critical areas in cyberspace, especially in the field of education, as distance learning and social distance have increased their dependence on digital technologies and connectivity. Many recent cyberattacks on e-learning systems, educational content services, and trainee management systems have created severe demands for specialized technological solutions to protect the security of modern training methods. Email is one of the most critical technologies of educational organizations that are attacked daily by spam, phishing campaigns, and all kinds of malicious programs. Considering the efforts made by the global research community to ensure educational processes, this study presents an advanced deep attention collaborative filter for secure academic email services. It is a specialized application of intelligent techniques that, for the first time, examines and models the problem of spam as a system of graphs where collaborative referral systems undertake the processing and analysis of direct and indirect social information to detect and categorize spam emails. In this study, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is applied to the social graph adjacent table to place users in one (or more) overlapping communities. Also, using a deep attention mechanism, it becomes personalized for each user. At the same time, with the introduction of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in the process of factorization, local dependencies are significantly mitigated to achieve the revelation of malicious communities. This methodology is being tested successfully in implementing mail protection systems for educational organizations. According to the findings, the proposed algorithm outperforms all other compared algorithms in every metric tested.

J	He, ZW; Wang, W; Dong, J; Tan, TN				He, Ziwen; Wang, Wei; Dong, Jing; Tan, Tieniu			Revisiting ensemble adversarial attack	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Adversarial attack; Ensemble strategies; Gradient-based methods; Deep neural networks; Image classification		Deep neural networks have shown vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Adversarial examples generated with an ensemble of source models can effectively attack unseen target models, posing a security threat to practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the manner of ensemble adversarial attacks from the viewpoint of network gradients with respect to inputs. We observe that most ensemble adversarial attacks simply average gradients of the source models, ignoring their different contributions in the ensemble. To remedy this problem, we propose two novel ensemble strategies, the Magnitude-Agnostic Bagging Ensemble (MABE) strategy and Gradient-Grouped Bagging And Stacking Ensemble (G2BASE) strategy. The former builds on a bagging ensemble and leverages a gradient normalization module to rebalance the ensemble weights. The latter divides diverse models into different groups according to the gradient magnitudes and combines an intragroup bagging ensemble with an intergroup stacking ensemble. Experimental results show that the proposed methods enhance the success rate in white-box attacks and further boost the transferability in black-box attacks.

However, existing methods rely on manual selection of triggers and backdoor representations, hindering their effectiveness and universality across different PLMs or usage paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which overcomes these limitations by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we design poisoned supervised contrastive learning, which can automatically learn more uniform and universal backdoor representations. This allows for more even coverage of the output space, thus hitting more labels in downstream tasks after fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize gradient search to select appropriate trigger words that can be adapted to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that UOR achieves better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Moreover, we test on PLMs with different architectures, usage paradigms, and more challenging tasks, achieving higher scores for universality.

In addressing this issue, this paper proposes a novel risk assessment model with the example of cyber attacks on SCADA systems. To begin with, a risk propagation model is employed to construct a node network diagram for the SCADA system, facilitating the analysis of attack pathways and probabilities. Subsequently, physical metrics on the power side of the distribution network are established to quantify the physical consequences. Furthermore, defense costs against cyber attacks are computed, forming the basis for the development of a multi-objective optimization model for defense resources tailored to measurement devices, in conjunction with the proposed risk assessment model. Case studies and results demonstrate the performance of the proposed risk assessment model and defense resource optimization approach by contrast with existing ones.

However, the emergence of click fraud greatly reduces the real benefits of the advertisement. Most existing researches focus on detecting click fraud by analyzing properties and patterns of click data streams, but attackers can construct data that looks legitimate by replaying former data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel system called ClickGuard to detect click fraud attacks. ClickGuard takes advantage of motion sensor signals from mobile devices, since the pattern of motion signals is completely different under real click events and fraud events. To prevent attackers from bypassing the system by faking the time-domain statistical characteristics of original signals, we introduce the MFCC algorithm in feature extraction phase. MFCC algorithm can extract frequency-domain features of original signals in specific frequency bands which are hardly constructed out of thin air. Classifiers are finally constructed using these features and several machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that ClickGuard can achieve the accuracy of 96.71% in general environment and 84.16% when attackers modify the time-domain statistical characteristics of raw data.

Malicious Activities Prediction Over Online Social Networking Using Ensemble Model	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Online social network; decision tree; weighted measure; clone attack; predictive measures	MALWARE	With the vast advancements in Information Technology, the emergence of Online Social Networking (OSN) has also hit its peak and captured the attention of the young generation people. The clone intends to replicate the users and inject massive malicious activities that pose a crucial security threat to the original user. However, the attackers also target this height of OSN utilization, explicitly creating the clones of the user's account. Various clone detection mechanisms are designed based on social-network activities. For instance, monitoring the occurrence of clone edges is done to restrict the generation of clone activities. However, this assumption is unsuitable for a real-time environment and works optimally during the simulation process. This research concentrates on modeling and efficient clone prediction and avoidance methods to help the social network activists and the victims enhance the clone prediction accuracy. This model does not rely on assumptions. Here, an ensemble Adaptive Random Subspace is used for classifying the clone victims with k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) as a base classifier. The weighted clone nodes are analysed using the weighted graph theory concept based on the classified results. When the weighted node's threshold value is higher, the trust establishment is terminated, and the clones are ranked and sorted in the higher place for termination. Thus, the victims are alert to the clone propagation over the online social networking end, and the validation is done using the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. The model shows a better trade-off than existing approaches like Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and the standard graph model. Various performance metrics like True Positive Rate (TPR), False Alarm Rate (FAR), Recall, Precision, F-measure, and ROC and run time analysis are evaluated to show the significance of the model.

J	Chang, RI; Lin, TC; Lin, JW				Chang, Ray-, I; Lin, Tzu-Chieh; Lin, Jeng-Wei			A Vehicle Passive Entry Passive Start System with the Intelligent Internet of Things	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Passive Entry Passive Start; smart watch; electrocardiogram; ECG; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Auto Encoder; collective decision		With the development of sensor and communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) subsystem is gradually becoming a crucial part in vehicles. It can effectively enhance functionalities of vehicles. However, new attack types are also emerging. For example, a driver with the smart key in their pocket can push the start button to start a car. At the same time, security issues in the push-to-start scenario are pervasive, such as smart key forgery. In this study, we propose a vehicle Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) system that adopts deep learning algorithms to recognize the driver using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals measured on the driver's smart watch. ECG signals are used for personal identification. Smart watches, serving as new smart keys of the PEPS system, can improve convenience and security. In the experiment, we consider commercial smart watches capable of sensing ECG signals. The sample rate and precision are typically lower than those of a 12-lead ECG used in hospitals. The experimental results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models achieve the best accuracy score for identity recognition (91%) when a single ECG cycle is used. However, it takes at least 30 min for training. The training of a personalized Auto Encoder model takes only 5 min for each subject. When 15 continuous ECG cycles are sensed and used, this can achieve 100% identity accuracy. As the personalized Auto Encoder model is an unsupervised learning one-class recognizer, it can be trained using only the driver's ECG signal. This will simplify the management of ECG recordings extremely, as well as the integration of the proposed technology into PEPS vehicles. A FIDO (Fast Identify Online)-like environment for the proposed PEPS system is discussed. Public key cryptography is adopted for communication between the smart watch and the PEPS car. The driver is first verified on the smart watch via local ECG biometric authentication, and then identified by the PEPS car. Phishing attacks, MITM (man in the middle) attacks, and replay attacks can be effectively prevented.

These secondary authentication factors-presently deployed at Google, Microsoft, and other major identity providers as part of risk-aware authentication-trigger in response to a suspicious login or account recovery attempt. Using Google as a case study, we evaluate the effectiveness of fourteen device-based, delegation-based, knowledge-based, and resource-based challenges at preventing over 350,000 real-world hijacking attempts stemming from automated bots, phishers, and targeted attackers. We show that knowledge-based challenges prevent as few as 10% of hijacking attempts rooted in phishing and 73% of automated hijacking attempts. Device-based challenges provide the best protection, blocking over 94% of hijacking attempts rooted in phishing and 100% of automated hijacking attempts. We evaluate the usability limitations of each challenge based on a sample of 1.2M legitimate users. Our results illustrate that login challenges act as an important barrier to hijacking, but that friction in the process leads to 52% of legitimate users failing to sign-in-though 97% of users eventually access their account in a short period.

So the Internet of things is a new paradigm. When the computing, pervasive computing, and the relevant technologies are more closely interdependent to each other and the world of Internet of things form a system. More and more people become fond in the real and digital worlds, and continuously in symbiotic interaction. In this situation, to protect the online users such as the usernames and passwords is important. One intelligent approach based on data mining called Associative Classification seems a potential solution that may effectively detect phishing websites with high accuracy. We first review relationship between the data mining and the Internet of things. Then we highlight the potential solution.

WBSNs consist of many tiny biosensor nodes that are continuously monitoring diverse physiological signals such as BP (systolic and diastolic), ECG, EMG, SpO2, and activity recognition and transmit these sensed patients' sensitive information to the central node, which is straight communicate with the controller. To disseminate this sensitive patient information from the controller to remote Medical Server (MS) needs to be prolonged high-speed wireless technology, i.e., LTE, UMTS, WiMAX, WiFi, and satellite communication. It is a challenging task for the controller to choose the optimal network to disseminate various patient vital signs, i.e., emergency data, normal data, and delay-sensitive data. According to the nature of various biosensor nodes in WBSNs, monitor patient vital signs and provide complete intelligent treatment when any abnormality occurs in the human body, i.e., accurate insulin injection when patient sugar level increased. In this paper, first, we select the optimal network from accessible networks using four different fuzzy attribute-based decision-making techniques (Triangular Cubic Hesistent Fuzzy Weighted Averaging Operator, Neutrosophic Linguistic TOPSIS method, Trangualar Cubic Hesistent Fuzzy Hamacher Weighted Averaging Operator and Cubic Grey Relational Analysis) depending upon the quality of service requirement for various application of WBSNs to prolong the human life, enhanced the society's medical treatment and indorse living qualities of people. Similarly, leakage and misuse of patient data can be a security threat to human life. Thus, confidential data transmission is of great importance. For this purpose, in our proposed scheme, we used HECC for secure key exchange and an AES algorithm to secure patient vital signs to protect patient information from illegal usage. Furthermore, MAC protocol is used for mutual authentication among sensor nodes and Base Stations (BS). Mathematical results show that our scheme is efficient for optimal network selection in such circumstances where conflict arises among diverse QoS requirements for different applications of WBSNs.

One such challenge is to 'undo' the effect of a specific subset of dataset used for training a model. This specific subset may contain malicious or adversarial data injected by an attacker, which affects the model performance. Another reason may be the need for a service provider to remove data pertaining to a specific user to respect the user's privacy. In both cases, the problem is to 'unlearn' a specific subset of the training data from a trained model without incurring the costly procedure of retraining the whole model from scratch. Towards this goal, this paper presents a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based machine unlearning (MCU) algorithm. MCU helps to effectively and efficiently unlearn a trained model from subsets of training dataset. Furthermore, we show that with MCU, we are able to explain the effect of a subset of a training dataset on the model prediction. Thus, MCU is useful for examining subsets of data to identify the adversarial data to be removed. Similarly, MCU can be used to erase the lineage of a user's personal data from trained ML models, thus upholding a user's "right to be forgotten". We empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed MCU algorithm on real-world phishing and diabetes datasets. Results show that MCU can achieve a desirable performance by efficiently removing the effect of a subset of training dataset and outperform an existing algorithm that utilizes the remaining dataset.

Existing defense methods mainly focus on detecting or eliminating the backdoor patterns after the model is backdoored. However, these methods either cause model performance degradation or heavily rely on impractical assumptions, such as labeled clean data, which exhibit limited effectiveness in federated learning. To this end, we propose FLPurifier, a novel backdoor defense method in federated learning that can effectively purify the possible backdoor attributes before federated aggregation. Specifically, FLPurifier splits a complete model into a feature extractor and classifier, in which the extractor is trained in a decoupled contrastive manner to break the strong correlation between trigger features and the target label. Compared with existing backdoor mitigation methods, FLPurifier doesn't rely on impractical assumptions since it can effectively purify the backdoor effects in the training process rather than an already trained model. Moreover, to decrease the negative impact of backdoored classifiers and improve global model accuracy, we further design an adaptive classifier aggregation strategy to dynamically adjust the weight coefficients.

However, some audio forensics methods presented in existing references were evaluated under either non-forensic oriented databases or private databases which were not publicly available. It creates difficulty for researchers to make comparison between different methods. In this paper we established VPCID, a VoIP phone call identification database for audio forensic purpose. As there is an increasing trend of phone scams or voice phishing via VoIP, through which the caller's identity can be hidden or forged easily, it is demanded to address the issues of identifying VoIP phone calls. The VPCID database is comprising of 1152 VoIP call recordings and 1152 mobile phone call recordings, each of which has more than two minutes. Recordings were collected from 48 different speakers using different smart phones and by considering varies recording conditions such as VoIP software, locations etc. We used MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and ACV (Amplitude Co-occurrence Vector) based features respectively equipped with SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to perform classification on the database. We also evaluated our own database on a CNN (convolutional neural network), but the performance is not too much satisfactory. Therefore the VoIP phone call identification problem is challenging and it calls for more effective solutions to address the problem. We hope our proposed database will convey more than this paper and inspire the future studies, which is openly available in below link, http://media-sec.szu.edu.cn/VPCID. html, and we welcome the use of this database.

Used to promote the acquisition of knowledge and deeply engage in learning activities, games are a potential medium to be explored. So far, research studies have mainly focused on cybersecurity and younger generations. Tapping into an underexplored research field and leveraging on the DigComp 2.2. framework, this research reports on a two-part workshop with eight experts in the fields of games, digital technologies, digital competences, and ageing. Its aim was to thoroughly delve into this underexplored research field, crafting game mechanics that not only consider the target audience but also directly respond to the areas outlined by DigComp. The results show six new game solutions, such as (i) identifying phishing emails and malware threats, (ii) assessing the authenticity of news items, (iii) acting as hackers to understand and create stronger passwords, (iv) optimizing search queries through interactive story search, (v) interpreting error messages, and (vi) navigating a simulated social media platform with personabased rewards. Therefore, the range of areas to be explored is expanded, including a wider variety of audiences and new solutions to be implemented. Moreover, the identified game offers practical tools for enhancing digital competences among older populations, and provide a roadmap for future research in designing empathetic digital solutions. Overall, this research highlights the unexplored potential at the intersection of these research fields, paving theway for future developments.

In this paper, we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically, an extra prompt token, called the switch token in this work, can turn the backdoor mode on, i.e., converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode, a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API, since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode, thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pretrained model, our proposed attack, named SWARM, learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents, and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides, we utilize the crossmode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack, i.e., achieving 95%+ attack success rate, and also being hard to be detected and removed.

The damage caused by smishing has become more severe, particularly with the proliferation of mobile devices. In smishing, a major difficulty faced by victims is discrimination between normal and smishing messages. To resolve this problem, we present an on-device smishing classifier based on a deep-learning model. In real-world scenarios, access to a substantial, authentic dataset is crucial. We trained and evaluated the classifier using real SMS datasets containing approximately 250,000 smishing messages and 950,000 normal messages obtained from victims in Korea. To ensure privacy, the classifier operates solely on mobile devices without externally transmitting any data. It utilizes a lightweight method that does not require significant computing power on mobile devices. We explored several models to determine a suitable model for mobile devices and optimized it using real datasets. Furthermore, our statistical analysis of actual smishing messages revealed that 98% of smishing messages are variants of previously sent messages. To address the prevalence of variant smishing messages, we propose a text evasion attack tool called EVA that is capable of generating pseudo-variant messages from a given message using an adversarial attack approach. We used this tool to evaluate and enhance the robustness of our classifier against various messages. Our classifier exhibited exceptional classification accuracy (0.99) while being lightweight (at 127 kB) and robust against variant smishing messages (attack success rate of 0.41).

These models can generate realistic speech signal of a known target that is difficult to differentiate from a bonafide voice of real human. This proved to be an issue by the recent security reports related to vishing attacks on bank call centers, fraud or pranking of public figures, and spoofing of voice authentication systems. Current approaches to address voice fraud issue are based on applying an Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) system. In most cases, these systems are tuned on datasets that consist of wideband quality bonafide and spoofed voice samples. This makes ASV systems vulnerable to speech signal degradation caused by voice encoding in cellular network and Voice over IP (VoIP). However, performance evaluation of ASV ( namely Equal Error Rate (EER) estimation) is almost exclusively available only for the cellular networks. Thus, performance of ASV systems for modern VoIP applications remains unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the modern ASV systems on audio compressed with codecs used in both cellular networks ( AMR and GSM codecs) and VoIP applications (G.711, G.722, AAC, Lyra and Opus codecs). In addition, ASV performance was tested using popular VoIP application (Discord). Obtained results have shown that codec application results in considerable (up to two times) EER increase compared to the baseline results. Moreover, we observed up to three times increase in EER on data transmitted using Discord. We propose to apply hard samples mining to the training process in order to improve the accuracy of ASV systems on compressed voice samples. It allows to reduce EER from 21% down to 16% even for the most distorted samples obtained after aggressive voice compression by GSM codecs. Note, that improvement for real VoIP application is even higher - with EER on Discord data decrease from 35% to 20%.

The advent of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), which benefits non-native speakers of English to access the Internet, poses a new hazard with non-English characters employed in domain names. Chinese domain name, as an important part of IDN, is attracting more and more attention. Unlike alphabetic writing, the form of Chinese character is very complicated. There exist plenty of Chinese characters with similar shape or similar pronunciation, which is very confusing to users. Many of the traditional detection technologies cannot be applied to the new situation. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of Chinese domain name piracy, and put forward three detection methods accordingly. The experiment results show that these detection methods are feasible and effective.

More importantly, some adversarial examples crafted against an ensemble of source models transfer to other target models and, thus, pose a security threat to black-box applications (when attackers have no access to the target models). Current transfer-based ensemble attacks, however, only consider a limited number of source models to craft an adversarial example and, thus, obtain poor transferability. Besides, recent query-based black-box attacks, which require numerous queries to the target model, not only come under suspicion by the target model but also cause expensive query cost. In this article, we propose a novel transfer-based black-box attack, dubbed serial-minigroup-ensemble-attack (SMGEA). Concretely, SMGEA first divides a large number of pretrained white-box source models into several "minigroups." For each minigroup, we design three new ensemble strategies to improve the intragroup transferability. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm that recursively accumulates the "long-term" gradient memories of the previous minigroup to the subsequent minigroup. This way, the learned adversarial information can be preserved, and the intergroup transferability can be improved. Experiments indicate that SMGEA not only achieves state-of-the-art black-box attack ability over several data sets but also deceives two online black-box saliency prediction systems in real world, i.e., DeepGaze-II (https://deepgaze.bethgelab.org/) and SALICON (http://salicon.net/demo/). Finally, we contribute a new code repository to promote research on adversarial attack and defense over ubiquitous pixel-to-pixel computer vision tasks. We share our code together with the pretrained substitute model zoo at https://github.com/CZHQuality/AAA-Pix2pix.

J	Saravanan, S; Balasubramanian, UM				Saravanan, Selvam; Balasubramanian, Uma Maheswari			An Adaptive Scalable Data Pipeline for Multiclass Attack Classification in Large-Scale IoT Networks	BIG DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS			English	Article						Training; Machine learning algorithms; Pipelines; Clustering algorithms; Telecommunication traffic; Cluster computing; Real-time systems; Internet of Things (IoT); Apache Spark; Apache Kafka; MongoDB; streaming; concept drift		The current large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks typically generate high-velocity network traffic streams. Attackers use IoT devices to create botnets and launch attacks, such as DDoS, Spamming, Cryptocurrency mining, Phishing, etc. The service providers of large-scale IoT networks need to set up a data pipeline to collect the vast network traffic data from the IoT devices, store it, analyze it, and report the malicious IoT devices and types of attacks. Further, the attacks originating from IoT devices are dynamic, as attackers launch one kind of attack at one time and another kind of attack at another time. The number of attacks and benign instances also vary from time to time. This phenomenon of change in attack patterns is called concept drift. Hence, the attack detection system must learn continuously from the ever-changing real-time attack patterns in large-scale IoT network traffic. To meet this requirement, in this work, we propose a data pipeline with Apache Kafka, Apache Spark structured streaming, and MongoDB that can adapt to the ever-changing attack patterns in real time and classify attacks in large-scale IoT networks. When concept drift is detected, the proposed system retrains the classifier with the instances that cause the drift and a representative subsample instances from the previous training of the model. The proposed approach is evaluated with the latest dataset, IoT23, which consists of benign and several attack instances from various IoT devices. Attack classification accuracy is improved from 97.8% to 99.46% by the proposed system.

Currently, most efforts to attack GNNs mainly use gradient information to guide the attacks and achieve superior performance. However, gradient-based attacks often lead to suboptimal results due to the discrete structure of graph data. The high complexity of time and space for large-scale graphs also take away the advantage of gradient attacks. In this work, we propose an attack method based on Important Nodes Controllable Labels (INCLA), which finds the set of important nodes for each class in the graph that have a great influence on the network during the graph convolution process and connects the target nodes to the important nodes to achieve the attack effect. In addition, since the gradient optimization attacks in graph neural networks are all salience attacks, which lead to their poor unnoticeability. We construct more unnoticeable adversarial examples based on the association between target nodes and important nodes, and use the Degree Assortativity Change (DAC) metric and Homophily Ratio Change (HRC) metric for verification. Extensive experimental results show that INCLA can significantly improve the time efficiency while maintaining the attack performance compared to the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks with the same attack budget.

We seek to address this challenge by proposing a design space as a structured way to examine and explore the multidimensional space of intelligent and interactive writing assistants. Through community collaboration, we explore five aspects of writing assistants: task, user, technology, interaction, and ecosystem. Within each aspect, we define dimensions and codes by systematically reviewing 115 papers, while leveraging the expertise of researchers in various disciplines. Our design space aims to offer researchers and designers a practical tool to navigate, comprehend, and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid in the design of new writing assistants.

However, there exist also harmful and/or malicious networks, from social ones like spreading hoax, corruption, phishing, extremist ideology, and terrorist support up to computer networks spreading computer viruses or DDoS attack software or even biological networks of carriers or transport centers spreading disease among the population. New attack strategy can be therefore used against malicious networks, as well as in a worst-case scenario test for robustness of a useful network. A common measure of robustness of networks is their disintegration level after removal of a fraction of nodes. This robustness can be calculated as a ratio of the number of nodes of the greatest remaining network component against the number of nodes in the original network. Our paper presents a combination of heuristics optimized for an attack on a complex network to achieve its greatest disintegration. Nodes are deleted sequentially based on a heuristic criterion. Efficiency of classical attack approaches is compared to the proposed approach on Barabasi-Albert, scale-free with tunable power-law exponent, and Erdos-Renyi models of complex networks and on real-world networks. Our attack strategy results in a faster disintegration, which is counterbalanced by its slightly increased computational demands.

While existing defense methods have demonstrated promising results on detecting or erasing backdoors, it is still not clear whether robust training methods can be devised to prevent the backdoor triggers being injected into the trained model in the first place. In this paper, we introduce the concept of anti-backdoor learning, aiming to train clean models given backdoor-poisoned data. We frame the overall learning process as a dual-task of learning the clean and the backdoor portions of data. From this view, we identify two inherent characteristics of backdoor attacks as their weaknesses: 1) the models learn backdoored data much faster than learning with clean data, and the stronger the attack the faster the model converges on backdoored data; 2) the backdoor task is tied to a specific class (the backdoor target class). Based on these two weaknesses, we propose a general learning scheme, Anti-Backdoor Learning (ABL), to automatically prevent backdoor attacks during training. ABL introduces a two-stage gradient ascent mechanism for standard training to 1) help isolate backdoor examples at an early training stage, and 2) break the correlation between backdoor examples and the target class at a later training stage. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 10 state-of-the-art attacks, we empirically show that ABL-trained models on backdoor-poisoned data achieve the same performance as they were trained on purely clean data.

Experimental environment has been constructed with 1/27 scale remote controlled car, motion tracking system, and a computer that sends steering and thrust commands to the RC car based on feedback from the motion tracking system. The control consists of two layers. Low-level controller receives a desired velocity vector as a reference and do a basic PI control for thrust and P control for steering. High-level controller is trained by reinforcement learning that receives the car state and outputs the velocity command vector. The state include position, velocity, heading of the RC car, distances to surrounding boundaries of the circuit. The high-level controller takes the form of a recursive neural network, which is trained entirely in virtual environment. The car dynamics in the virtual environment is a bicycle model that includes tire slip force from the literature. With the resulting policy (high-level controller) the RC car successfully completes 10 laps in the actual environment of the circuit without colliding to the boundaries.

The openness of communication networks in microgrids can lead to privacy breaches, which pose a serious threat to the entire electricity market. As such, this paper presents a distributed ED algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where a quantization-based encryption and decryption rule is integrated to avoid privacy leakage while iteratively acquiring the optimal ED scheme. By resorting to the property of monotonically convergent sequences, a sufficient condition about the learning rate is profoundly revealed to guarantee the algorithm convergence. Two extended results are presented, respectively, to enhance the convergence rate and meet the requirement of plug-and-play scenarios. Finally, the validity (both privacy and optimality) of the proposed algorithm is verified by using the dual-source trolleybus system in Beijing. Note to Practitioners-This paper develops an engineering-oriented ED algorithm that optimizes the total generation costs of smart grids online while guaranteeing system constraints. Shared network communication undoubtedly plays a significant role in achieving iteratively the optimal solution of distributed algorithms. However, some crucial and sensitive information exchanged via an open and shared network could be eavesdropped by malicious attackers, which could result in a serious security threat affecting the reliability and stability of the smart grid. To overcome such a shortage, an encryption-decryption rule is constructed via a dynamic quantizer. In light of such a rule, the presented algorithm based on ADMM can iteratively acquire the optimal ED solution in a distributed way, realizing the requirements of optimality and privacy. The desired range of the learning rate is disclosed to guide the parameter selection, and two improved versions are proposed to meet more general engineering practice involving plug-and-play scenarios.

Despite the increasing popularity of fuzzing, automated root cause analysis (RCA) has drawn less attention. One of the recent advances in RCA is crash-based statistical debugging, which leverages the behavioral differences in program execution between crash-triggered and non-crashing inputs. Hence, obtaining non-crashing behaviors close to the original crash is crucial but challenging with previous approaches (e.g., fuzzing). In this paper, we present BENZENE, a practical end-to-end RCA system that facilitates an automated crash diagnosis. To this end, we introduce a novel technique, called under-constrained state mutation, that generates both crashing and non-crashing behaviors for effective and efficient RCA. We design and implement the BENZENE prototype, and evaluate it with 60 vulnerabilities in the wild. Our empirical results demonstrate that BENZENE not only surpasses in performance (i.e., root cause ranking), but also achieves superior results in both speed (4.6 times faster) and memory footprint (31.4 times less) on average than prior approaches.

Their users typically develop trust relationships with the accounts of other users. But large numbers of users and potential gains from abuses of the trust relationships have attracted the attention of cyber-criminals. Therefore, it is important to stop accounts from being compromised by these criminals. In this paper, an anomaly model trained on the previous login data of users is applied to detection of compromised accounts. The login data comes from the Pokec online social network, which is the largest community in Slovakia where people can meet others and talk to their friends. The anomaly model watches sudden changes in the behavior of a user trying to log in to her or his account. A change in the behavior can indicate an attempt from someone else to compromise the account of the user. The efficiency of the anomaly model is validated with computation of measures such as sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. Achieved results are promising with a real potential to detect compromised accounts.
